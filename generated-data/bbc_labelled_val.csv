"Firms signing up for the sensing system include MCI, BT, Deutsche Telekom, Energis, NTT, Bell Canada and many others.",0.0,19.0
The creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by US firm Arbor Networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack.,1.0,30.0
"Increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites, launch worms and relay spam around the net.",1.0,27.0
"""We have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic,"" said Rob Pollard, sales director for Arbor Networks which is behind the fingerprinting system.",1.0,25.0

"""What we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source,"" said Mr Pollard.",1.0,32.0
Arbor Network's technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network.,0.0,15.0
It spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups.,0.0,23.0
Any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind.,0.0,29.0
This type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines.,0.0,22.0

Court mulls file-sharing future,0.0,4.0
Judges at the US Supreme Court have been hearing evidence for and against file-sharing networks.,1.0,15.0

Legal experts agree that if the Supreme Court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file-trading firms into bankruptcy.,1.0,27.0
"But if the judge rules that Grokster and Morpheus - the file-sharers at the centre of the case - are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses, then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file-sharing providers.",1.0,49.0

"The report reveals that 84% of net users say they regularly use Google, Ask Jeeves, MSN and Yahoo when online.",0.0,20.0
"Almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less, if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden.",1.0,25.0
According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt.,0.0,30.0
"A significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks.",0.0,24.0
"For 44% of those questioned, the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find.",0.0,26.0
Search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it.,0.0,26.0
"According to Pew Research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites.",0.0,28.0
"Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves, said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query.",1.0,38.0
Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes.,1.0,20.0
"A small number, 17%, said they wouldn't really miss search engines if they did not exist.",1.0,16.0
The remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites.,0.0,11.0
"More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net.",0.0,36.0
Alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web.,1.0,29.0
"Of those asked, 62% were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search.",0.0,23.0
Only 18% of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not.,0.0,18.0

TV's future down the phone line,0.0,6.0
Internet TV has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now.,1.0,17.0

There are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net's power.,0.0,21.0
"Jeremy Allaire, chief of Brightcove, told the BBC News website that it would be a flavour of IPTV that was about harnessing the web as a ""channel"".",1.0,27.0

"This type of IPTV service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives, for instance.",1.0,36.0

the ons says gross domestic product gdp rose by strong 0.7 in the three months to 31 december compared with 0.5 in the previous quarter,0.0,25.0
the rise came despite further decline in production output and the worst christmas for retailers in decades,0.0,17.0

whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year recession is not word that manufacturers would currently recognise,0.0,18.0
the ons said sharp fall in mining and quarrying which was driven by oil and gas extraction was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures,1.0,28.0
simon rubinsohn chief economist at gerrard said this outturn of 0.7 was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the uk economy,1.0,36.0
and he said the gdp figures may help to push interest rate expectations little higher along the curve,1.0,18.0
the suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than downward direction,0.0,24.0

it all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for new audience but for me lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it,1.0,57.0
it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation,1.0,50.0

by increasing overheads for business there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt or that pair of trainers for next to nothing,1.0,51.0

although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential,1.0,19.0

increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery,0.0,26.0
80 of my costs are labour,0.0,6.0
the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses,1.0,56.0
it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status jobs,1.0,25.0

mr straw speaking at joint news conference with chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing stressed this point,0.0,16.0

earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months,0.0,15.0
but mr straw faces tough opposition to the move,0.0,9.0
tory foreign affairs spokesman michael ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be irresponsible and would damage britain relations with the us,0.0,22.0
he said mr straw was naive beyond belief if he accepted china claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons,1.0,25.0
the french want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to china the chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from europe,1.0,30.0

the tories said they would not cut spending but agreed public spending would increase more slowly under their plans leading to total of 33.5bn less spending than that anticipated by labour by 2011,1.0,33.0

the government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been disappointing,0.0,27.0
ministers say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments,0.0,23.0
they also want to set up new half-way house where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that individual budget,1.0,32.0
the scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until 2008,0.0,11.0

mr brown said that it was vital the uk continued to invest in infrastructure science and education in the future,1.0,20.0
otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of china he told mps,0.0,13.0
the chancellor said that the eu planned changes in the growth and stability pact designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much would force britain to run budget surplus of over the economic cycle,1.0,40.0
under mr brown rules the uk current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit,1.0,27.0
he told the house of commons treasury select committee that the eu rules make it difficult for low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure,0.0,32.0
but he argued that the eu was moving in the direction of the uk principles and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over longer period than one year to include investment and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year,0.0,53.0
under mr brown sustainable investment rule government debt should be under 40 in contrast to the 60 allowed under the growth and stability pact,1.0,24.0

in march the office of national statistics ons reclassified 3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment shortly before the chancellor announced in the budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only 6bn,0.0,38.0
conservative michael fallon asked mr brown whether the treasury had leaned on ons to make this change and said that the ons had received written paper from the treasury on this matter,1.0,32.0

the essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be fake he said,0.0,19.0
the warning is about the european constitution which we are going to have vote on in year or two and that centralises and entrenches these rules in constitution,0.0,28.0
it gives more powers to brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy,0.0,14.0

the ifs says the drop partly reflects measures announced in what it called the chancellor tax-raising budget of 2002,0.0,19.0
the treasury dismissed the research as complete rubbish,0.0,8.0
party election supremo alan milburn said the apparent drop in average incomes was because self-employed people had been affected by world downturn which hit their profits,1.0,26.0

tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be general election on may,0.0,21.0
the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling snap poll it has not shifted,1.0,36.0

the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is stark choice between labour stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust,1.0,39.0
and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster to underline that economic message,0.0,28.0
and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties tax and spend policies,1.0,26.0
during the phoney campaign labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning 35 bn cuts in public services,1.0,23.0
the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how smaller slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour plans was cut,0.0,24.0
and it looked like the labour campaign which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health was on the rocks,1.0,32.0
then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger cuts,1.0,19.0
he was sacked for his gaffe but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track,1.0,21.0
second central argument will be over taxation with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again,1.0,35.0
mr brown slaps that aside claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate,0.0,21.0
as usual the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties,0.0,24.0

the fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little the report concludes,1.0,36.0

local net tv takes off in austria,0.0,7.0
an austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television,0.0,13.0
the people of engerwitzdorf are filming editing and producing their own regional news channel,0.0,14.0
the channel covers local politics sports events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on pcs,0.0,25.0
the pilot has been so successful that telekom austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere,1.0,17.0
it growing unbelievably fast said rudolf fischer head of telekom austria fixed line division,0.0,14.0
"the trial of buntes fernsehen multi-coloured tv was started in late 2004 and creates net-based tv station run by the 8,000 residents of engerwitzdorf",0.0,24.0
the hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by telekom austria but this equipment following training has been turned over to the villagers,0.0,29.0
any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to buntes fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch,1.0,24.0
most people watch the tv on their home pc and broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes,1.0,19.0
in the first four months of the project villagers have created 60 films and put together regular reports on local news items,0.0,22.0
they have adopted it very quickly said mr fischer,0.0,9.0
they like the possibility to create their own content and see what going on in the area,0.0,17.0
it kind of the democratisation of local tv he said because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region,0.0,25.0
the buntes fernsehen project has been such success that telekom austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas,1.0,22.0
mr fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes,1.0,34.0
the engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of telekom austria online tv channel aon which lets people watch programmes on their pc,1.0,21.0
aon streams couple of live channels plus sports news and music programmes on to the net and has pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it,1.0,33.0
in october larger tv-on-demand project is due to launch in vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net,1.0,21.0
the body that oversees how the net works grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last 10 years but it is just the start,1.0,30.0
in sense we have hardly started in reaching the whole population the new chair of the internet engineering task force ietf brian carpenter says,1.0,24.0
the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net architecture,0.0,12.0
with broadband take-up growing services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net,1.0,17.0
think voip voice-over internet protocol allowing phone calls to be made over the net is very important it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms says dr carpenter,1.0,29.0
second it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be service provider with lot of infrastructure,0.0,19.0
with voip you need very little infrastructure,0.0,7.0
distinguished ibm engineer dr carpenter spent 20 years at cern the european laboratory for particle physics,0.0,16.0
as the new chair of the ietf his next big challenge is overseeing ipv6 the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web,1.0,26.0
at cern dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web so he is well-placed to take on such task,1.0,26.0
the net growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is crucial job of the ietf,1.0,26.0
the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work are open and free for anyone to use and work with,1.0,25.0
the net is built on protocol called tcp ip which means transmission control protocol and internet protocol,0.0,17.0
when computers communicate with the net unique ip address is used to send and receive information,1.0,16.0
the ietf is large international community of network designers operators vendors and researchers working on the evolution of the net architecture and the way this information is sent and received,0.0,30.0
they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps,0.0,10.0
we ve seen some interesting effects over last few years explains dr carpenter,0.0,13.0
the net was growing at fantastic rate at the end of the 90s,1.0,13.0
then there was bit of glitch in 2000,0.0,8.0
we are now seeing very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth,0.0,12.0
that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies like china which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies,1.0,23.0
the number of broadband subscribers via dsl digital subscriber line doubled in year to 13 million according to figures released at the end of 2004,0.0,25.0
the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate explained dr carpenter,1.0,19.0
given it the net was designed for the whole community it has done well to reach millions,1.0,17.0
if you want to reach the whole population you have to make sure it can scale up,0.0,17.0
ipv6 the standard that will replace the existing ipv4 will allow for billions more addresses on the net and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world,1.0,30.0
the actual number of addresses with ipv4 is limited to four billion ip addresses,0.0,14.0
that clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve so there is technical solution the new version of ip ipv6,0.0,24.0
it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits said dr carpenter,1.0,14.0
standards are vital to something as complex as the net and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is big task,1.0,25.0
the difference this next generation standard ipv6 will make to the average net user is almost invisible,1.0,17.0
our first goal is that it ipv6 should make no difference people should not notice difference,0.0,16.0
it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer,0.0,10.0
lot of the process will be invisible,0.0,7.0
people are usually given an ip address without knowing it,0.0,10.0
technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled said dr carpenter,1.0,15.0
the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security,0.0,13.0
to dr carpenter the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour,0.0,12.0
people have to be educated about sensible behaviour he says such as ignoring e-mails that claim you have won something,0.0,20.0
don think it is going to get worse,0.0,8.0
people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do just as you would be concerned walking along dark street,0.0,21.0
we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards,1.0,14.0
it is never-ending battle in sense,0.0,6.0
but he adds even if security has improved you still worry bit,0.0,12.0
unfortunately it is just part of life,0.0,7.0
we have duty to do what we can,0.0,8.0

ever since laptops appeared the amount of time they last between recharges has been frustration for users,0.0,17.0
survey carried out in 2000 by forrester research found that the shortness of battery life was the most complained about feature of laptops,0.0,23.0
the focus back then was more on performance and features said mike trainor chief mobile technology evangelist for chip giant intel,0.0,21.0
for most of the 90s battery life was stuck on two to 2.5 hours,0.0,14.0
but now he said laptops can last much longer,0.0,9.0
it was not just case of improving battery life by squeezing more out of the lithium ion power packs he explained,1.0,21.0
other changes are needed to get to the holy grail of laptop running for about eight hours before needing recharge,0.0,20.0
lithium ion is never going to get there by itself he said,0.0,12.0
the industry has done great job of wringing all possible energy storage out of that technology that they can,0.0,19.0
some new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space said mr trainor though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturing,1.0,32.0
he was sceptical that fuel cells would develop quick enough to take over from solid batteries even though they have the potential to produce several times more energy than lithium ion power packs,1.0,33.0

intel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside laptop and find ways to make them less power hungry,1.0,26.0
this work has led to the creation of the mobile pc extended battery life ebl working group that shares information about building notebooks that are more parsimonious with power,1.0,29.0
some of the improvements in power use come simply because components on chips are shrinking said mr trainor,1.0,18.0
intel has also changed the way it creates transistors on silicon to reduce the power they need,1.0,17.0
on larger scale said mr trainor improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make notebook more energy efficient,1.0,30.0
also said mr trainor research is being done on ways to cut energy consumption on displays currently the biggest power guzzler on laptop,1.0,23.0
many laptop makers have committed to creating 14 and 15 inch screens that draw only three watts of power,0.0,19.0

the creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by us firm arbor networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack,1.0,30.0
increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites launch worms and relay spam around the net,1.0,27.0
we have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic said rob pollard sales director for arbor networks which is behind the fingerprinting system,1.0,25.0
attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination he said,0.0,20.0
once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem,1.0,29.0
mr pollard said arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected,1.0,21.0
what we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source said mr pollard,1.0,32.0
arbor network technology works by building up detailed history of traffic on network,0.0,13.0
it spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups,0.0,23.0
any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to net-based attack of some kind,0.0,28.0
this type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines,0.0,22.0
anyone looking at the traffic on machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of concerted attack,0.0,23.0

judges at the us supreme court have been hearing evidence for and against file-sharing networks,1.0,15.0

they questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue file-sharers could deter innovation,0.0,16.0
they also said that file-trading firms had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy,0.0,14.0
the lawsuit brought by 28 of the world largest entertainment firms has raged for several years,0.0,16.0
legal experts agree that if the supreme court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file-trading firms into bankruptcy,1.0,27.0
but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus the file-sharers at the centre of the case are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file-sharing providers,1.0,47.0
instead they would have to pursue individuals who use peer-to-peer networks to get their hands on free music and movies,0.0,20.0
the hi-tech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue,0.0,11.0

he said that while file-trading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music conceptually the technology had some really excellent uses,1.0,23.0
based on tuesday hearing it seems unlikely that the betamax ruling will be overturned but file-sharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy,1.0,27.0

sun offers processing by the hour,0.0,6.0
sun microsystems has launched pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour,1.0,20.0
sun grid costs users 53p for an hour worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun,1.0,19.0
so-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in company which believes that computing capacity is as important commodity as hardware and software,1.0,23.0
sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity,1.0,9.0
the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed said sun chief operating officer jonathan schwartz,0.0,23.0
why build your own grid when you can use ours for buck an hour,0.0,14.0
he asked in webcast launching sun quarterly network computing event in california,0.0,12.0
the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil gas and financial services industries,0.0,30.0
"some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each sun said",1.0,16.0
mr schwartz ran demonstration of the service showing how data could be processed in protein folding experiment,0.0,17.0
hundreds of servers were used simultaneously working on the problem for few seconds each,0.0,14.0
although it only took few seconds the experiment cost 12 6.30 because it had used up 12 hours worth of computing power,0.0,22.0
the sun grid relies on solaris the operating system owned by sun,1.0,12.0
initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers,0.0,22.0
it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has rival in ibm which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun,0.0,33.0
at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at handheld computer with stylus,1.0,17.0
they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised,0.0,12.0
it is pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks,1.0,31.0
matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non-governmental organisation uses combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e-slates,1.0,24.0
the e-slates connect via wireless connection to base station in the school,1.0,12.0
this in turn is connected to satellite radio receiver,0.0,9.0
the data is transmitted alongside audio signals,0.0,7.0
the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into form that can be read by the handheld e-slates,1.0,23.0
it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it,0.0,24.0
it also stores this on its hard disc,0.0,8.0
the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network,0.0,15.0
but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project,1.0,13.0
it very simple to set up just satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it also one-way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult,1.0,31.0
the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux-based system,0.0,24.0
the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions,0.0,11.0
users can scroll through these sections independently of each other,0.0,10.0
eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content,1.0,17.0
mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students,0.0,13.0
he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world largest university libraries,0.0,25.0
all books in the public domain something like 15 million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them,0.0,21.0
then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity,1.0,33.0
but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions,1.0,15.0
we plan to put solar panel at the school with the base station have the e-slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working,1.0,37.0
maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the e-slates says the project ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world,0.0,23.0
why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks,0.0,18.0
the fact that we are doing this in rural developing country is very exciting as they need it most,0.0,19.0
firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks,1.0,22.0
the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services,1.0,29.0
the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work,0.0,22.0
the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones,0.0,20.0
in the last couple of years ringtones wallpapers screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular,0.0,20.0
but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers said jeremy flynn head of third party services at vodafone,1.0,27.0
if you are not on the operator portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it problem of how people discover your services he said,0.0,28.0
to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers,0.0,21.0
this tactic involved signing people up for subscription to give them for instance several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting,0.0,29.0
mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of few weeks at the end of 2004,1.0,21.0
websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for,0.0,27.0
what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently said mr flynn,1.0,16.0
people did not know they were being offered subscription service,0.0,10.0
we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here he added,0.0,10.0
the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones,1.0,25.0
the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk phone firms,0.0,18.0
everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct said andrew bud regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox,0.0,25.0
it all about transparency he said,1.0,6.0
consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it,0.0,18.0
the consumer has right to be protected he said,1.0,9.0
christian harris partnership manager of mobile content firm zed said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads,1.0,27.0
the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out he said,0.0,23.0
the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them,0.0,27.0
some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for said mr flynn,1.0,26.0
also said mr flynn vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules,1.0,18.0
we have quite draconian contracts with firms he said,0.0,9.0
we do not have to say why,0.0,7.0
we can just cut them off,0.0,6.0
under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using universal stop command sent via text message,0.0,21.0
he said the system had been designed to limit how much consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for service,1.0,21.0
the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality said mr flynn,1.0,22.0

musiwave provides downloading infrastructure for the mobile phone market and mr babinet said the industry was enjoying definite momentum,1.0,19.0
but there are hurdles to overcome,0.0,6.0
mobile phones offer limited storage for music certainly nothing to rival apple 60gb ipod,1.0,14.0
but the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music enough for 250 songs,1.0,36.0
we are working in the hard disk area and we will be bringing out exciting devices jonas guest vice president for entertainment at nokia told the bbc news website,0.0,29.0
but will mobiles become mere storage devices,0.0,7.0
one of the problems we could have is that mobiles are used just for storage and playback while pcs are used for downloading said mr babinet,1.0,26.0
we don want people to cast aside their pcs we want mobile users to hook up into the existing ecosystems explained mr guest,1.0,23.0
you must enable people to transfer music from pc to handset and vice versa,1.0,14.0
one of the key elements of the nokia and microsoft deal is the agreed ability to transfer songs between handset and pc,0.0,22.0
microsoft will adopt open standards allowing music to cross boundaries for the first time,0.0,14.0
songs can be downloaded on pc or mobile and transferred between the platforms,0.0,13.0

"emi currently offers its entire 200,000 download catalogue for use by both by pcs and mobile phones",0.0,17.0

we want music to be continuum,1.0,6.0
the seamless experience of mobiles and pc downloads is approaching he predicted,1.0,12.0
mr babinet said the mobile phone had number of advantages over pcs which would see it become the focus for music downloading in the future,1.0,25.0
getting music from your pc onto device is not an easy experience,0.0,12.0
you have to switch the pc on load the operating system load the program buy the music download the music and then transfer the music,1.0,25.0
all of these steps can be done in one step on mobile phone,0.0,13.0
he said the mobile phone billing system would make it easier for teenagers to embrace downloads because pre-paid cards were already accepted by the age group,0.0,26.0
certainly we have problem with battery memory and bandwidth,0.0,9.0
but it not about the current status,0.0,7.0
you will have all of your music on your mobile,1.0,10.0
all three men said that the social interaction of mobile music would drive the market,1.0,15.0
mr cohen said can send you the song and it is either billed to me or send it to you and if you listen to it and want to keep it is billed to you,0.0,35.0

it the beginning of the end of the blind date as we know it said graeme oxby marketing director,0.0,19.0
the response has been so promising that says it is planning to launch proper commercial dating service soon,0.0,18.0
hundreds of hopefuls submitted their profiles and special booths were set up in major london department store for two weeks where expert tips were given on how to visually improve their chances,0.0,32.0
the 100 most popular contestants voted by the public will gather at the ica in separate rooms and meet by phone,0.0,21.0
dating services and other more adult match-making services are proving to be strong stream of revenue worth millions for mobile companies,1.0,21.0
whether it does actually provide an interesting match for video phone technologies remains to be seen,1.0,16.0
flic everett journalist and dating expert for company magazine and the daily express thinks technology has been liberating for some nervous soul-mate seekers,1.0,23.0
there are currently about 1.3 million video phones in use in the uk and three times more single people in britain than there were 30 years ago with more people buying video mobiles 3g dating could be the basis for successful and safe way to meet people,1.0,47.0
one of the problems with video phones is people don really know what to video,1.0,15.0
we have not quite worked out what it is for,0.0,10.0
this gives it focus and useful one she told bbc news,0.0,11.0
would never have thought online dating would take off the way it did she said,0.0,15.0
lots of people find it easier to be honest writing e-mail or text than face-to-face,0.0,15.0
lots people are quite shy and they feel vulnerable,1.0,9.0
when you are writing it comes directly onto the page so they tend to be more honest,0.0,17.0
but the barrier that comes with sms chat and online match-making is that the person behind the profile may not be who they really are,1.0,25.0
scare stories have put people off as result according to ms everett,0.0,12.0
many physical clues body language odd twitches are obviously missing with sms and online dating services,0.0,16.0
still images do not necessarily provide all those necessary cues,0.0,10.0
it could really take off because you do get the whole package,0.0,12.0
with static e-mail picture you don know who the person is behind it is,0.0,14.0
so checking out potential date by video phone also gives singletons different kind of barrier an extra layer of protection case of wlts before wltm,1.0,25.0
if you are trapped in real-life blind date context you can get away and you feel embarrassed,0.0,17.0
with video meeting you really have the barrier of the phone so if you don like them you don have to suffer the embarrassment,1.0,24.0
there is more serious side to this new use of technology though,0.0,12.0
with money being made through more adult-themes content and services which let people meet and chat the revenue streams for mobile carriers will grow with 3g thinks paolo pescatore mobile industry specialist for analysts idc,1.0,35.0
wireless is medium that is being exploited with number of features and services,0.0,13.0
one is chatting and the dating element is key there he said,1.0,12.0
the foundation has been set by sms and companies are using media like mms and video to grow the market further,1.0,21.0
but carriers need to be wary and ensure that if they do launch such 3g dating services they ensure mechanism are in place to monitor and be aware who is registers and accesses these services on regular basis he cautioned,0.0,40.0
in july vodafone introduced content control system to protect children from such adult content,0.0,14.0
the move was as result of code of practice agreed by the uk six largest mobile phone operators in january,0.0,20.0
the system means vodafone users need to prove they are over 18 before firewalls are lifted on explicit websites or chat rooms dealing with adult themes,0.0,26.0
the impetus was the growing number of people with handsets that could access the net and the growth of 3g technologies,1.0,21.0
by early 2005 the net could have two new domain names,1.0,11.0
the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net administrative body,1.0,16.0
the names are just two of total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann,1.0,25.0
the other proposed names include domain for pornography asia mobile phones an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture,1.0,22.0
the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices,0.0,36.0
the .travel domain would be used by hotels travel firms airlines tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online,0.0,21.0
it is backed by new york-based trade group called the travel partnership,0.0,12.0
icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted,1.0,26.0
despite this initial approval icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service,1.0,19.0
at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains,0.0,12.0
one that may not win approval is proposal to set up .xxx domain for pornographic websites,0.0,16.0
similar proposal has been made many times in the past,0.0,10.0
but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it,0.0,20.0
in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success,1.0,15.0
three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero,0.0,19.0
others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic,0.0,12.0
in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations,1.0,18.0
but domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous,0.0,14.0
four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year says report from analysts gartner,1.0,26.0
globally the number sold will reach 159 million an increase of 104,0.0,12.0
the report predicts that nearly 70 of all mobile phones sold will have built-in camera by 2008,1.0,17.0
improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly must-have buy,0.0,12.0
in europe cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images,1.0,10.0
but in japan and asia pacific where camera phone technology is much more advanced mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images,1.0,25.0
japan still dominates mobile phone technology and the uptake there is huge,0.0,12.0
by 2008 according to gartner 95 of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them,1.0,16.0
camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms multimedia messaging services,1.0,37.0
this has changed in the last 18 months,0.0,8.0
handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use,0.0,12.0
realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways they have introduced more design features like rotating screens and viewfinders removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages,1.0,33.0
mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people,0.0,14.0
these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites or mobile blogs moblogs,0.0,16.0
but the report suggests that until image quality increases more people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks,0.0,21.0
image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving,1.0,8.0
the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005 it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels,1.0,24.0
consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality and up to six megapixels on high-end camera,1.0,20.0
but lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras,1.0,15.0
some handsets already feature limited zoom capability and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions like nightclubs,0.0,26.0
other developments include wide-angle modes basic editing features and better sensors and processors for recording film clips,0.0,17.0
images from camera phones have even made it into the art world,1.0,12.0
an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists,0.0,21.0
the exhibition fonetography will feature images taken by photographers david bailey rankin and nan goldin and artists sir peter blake tracey emin and jack vettriano,0.0,25.0
but some uses for them have worried many organisations,0.0,9.0
intel samsung the uk foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked,0.0,32.0
many schools fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse,0.0,17.0
italy information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used,0.0,20.0
but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers profits,1.0,10.0
according to recent figures sony ericsson profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones,0.0,16.0
over 60 of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras it said,0.0,17.0
mobile multimedia slow to catch on,0.0,6.0
there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular,0.0,15.0
consumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for 26 increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004 according to analysts gartner more than 167 million handsets were sold globally between july and september 2004 period that according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is seldom strong,0.0,56.0
but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps sounds and video clips few so far are taking the chance to do so,0.0,25.0
in fact the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures audio and video is growing,0.0,16.0
figures gathered by continental research shows that 36 of british camera phone users have never sent multimedia message mms up from in 2003,1.0,23.0
this is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to 7.5 million,0.0,24.0
getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying,1.0,33.0
the problem they face said shailendra jain head of mms firm adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets,1.0,26.0
also he said they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it,0.0,20.0
research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to,1.0,19.0
according to continental research 29 of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation,0.0,21.0
only 11 regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send picture or video message,0.0,14.0
the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people reluctance to start sending them said mr jain,1.0,24.0
they ask themselves if streaming video from one handset to another will it work,0.0,14.0
there lot of user apprehension about that,0.0,7.0
there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might,0.0,18.0
andrew bud executive chairman of messaging firm mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system,1.0,31.0
the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant he said,1.0,15.0
the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users,0.0,24.0
no-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped said mr bud,1.0,23.0
this has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as wap-push to get multimedia to their customers,0.0,19.0
but when networks do find good way to get multimedia to their customers the results can be dramatic,1.0,18.0
israeli technology firm celltick has found way to broadcast data across phone networks in way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth,0.0,21.0
one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india the largest mobile firm in the country,0.0,20.0
the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems,0.0,19.0
while not multimedia messaging such system gets people used to seeing their phones as device that can handle all different types of content,1.0,23.0
as result 40 of the subscribers to the hutch alive which uses celltick broadcast technology regularly click for more pictures sounds and images from the operator,0.0,26.0
operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers said yaron toren spokesman for celltick,0.0,18.0
until then multimedia will be message that is not getting through,1.0,11.0
the net self-declared spam king is seeking bankruptcy protection,0.0,9.0
scott richter the man behind optinrealbig.com and billions of junk mail messages said lawsuits had forced the company into chapter 11,0.0,21.0
optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles most notably against microsoft which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages,1.0,19.0
the company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading,0.0,20.0
listed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog spamhaus optinrealbig was sued in december 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws,0.0,28.0
the lawsuit was brought by microsoft and new york attorney general eliot spitzer who alleged that mr richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries,1.0,34.0
according to microsoft the messages were sent via net addresses owned by the kuwait ministries of communication and finance several korean schools the seoul municipal boramae hospital and the virginia community college system,0.0,33.0
mr richter settled the attorney general case in july 2004 but the legal fight with microsoft is continuing,0.0,18.0
microsoft is seeking millions in dollars in damages from optinrealbig under anti-spam laws that impose penalties for every violation,0.0,19.0
in statement announcing the desire to seek bankruptcy protection the company said it could not continue to contend with legal maneuvers sic by number of companies across the country including microsoft and still run viable business,1.0,36.0
in its chapter 11 filing optinrealbig claimed it had assets of less than 10m 5.29m but debts of more than 50m which included the 46m that microsoft is seeking via its lawsuit,1.0,32.0
the litigation has been relentless distraction with which to contend said steven richter legal counsel for optinrealbig,1.0,17.0
but make no mistake we do expect to prevail,0.0,9.0
for its part optinrealbig describes itself as premier internet marketing company and said the move to seek chapter 11 was necessary to let it keep trading while sorting out its legal battles,1.0,32.0
peer-to-peer p2p networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says panel of industry experts,1.0,24.0
once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology,1.0,24.0
the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january,0.0,19.0
the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january,1.0,14.0
william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software,0.0,20.0
since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy,1.0,30.0
but that is going to change very soon according to the panel,0.0,12.0
the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks which are not illegal in themselves and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks,1.0,33.0
but they have slowly realised that p2p is good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want slice of it,1.0,35.0
they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards,0.0,22.0
but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with p2p can not not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks,1.0,21.0
remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said old media always tries to stop new media,0.0,21.0
when they can stop it they try to control it,0.0,10.0
then they figure out how to make money and they always make lot of money,0.0,15.0
once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business,0.0,24.0
in august 2004 the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two file-sharing networks,0.0,20.0
the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal,0.0,30.0
p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files,0.0,14.0
instead it uses direct connections between computers or clients,0.0,9.0
there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways,0.0,14.0
p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content,1.0,22.0
the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology,0.0,9.0
it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them,1.0,22.0
the files would be locked seven days after programme aired making rights management easier to control,0.0,16.0
but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many,0.0,10.0
the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half million films are downloaded day,0.0,24.0
legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content,0.0,23.0
sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004 with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months the ifpi reported this week,0.0,27.0
but such download services are very different from p2p networks not least because of the financial aspect,1.0,17.0
there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into golden egg for commercial entertainment companies,0.0,16.0
paid-for-pass-along in which firms receive money each time file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered,0.0,23.0
we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p said marc morgenstern vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer,1.0,21.0
consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern,0.0,15.0
but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations,1.0,28.0
unsigned bands for example use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign,1.0,26.0
increasingly what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content said derek broes from microsoft,1.0,15.0
they will probably play an increasing role in helping p2p spread he said,1.0,13.0
looking into p2p future file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks as far as mr broes is concerned,1.0,20.0
once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said,0.0,27.0
file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg,0.0,7.0
fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online research suggests,1.0,13.0
quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites according to report by uk think-tank demos,1.0,20.0
it said that having an always-on fast connection is changing the way people use the internet,0.0,16.0
more than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast,1.0,16.0
the demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people net habits,1.0,13.0
it found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast,0.0,17.0
one in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web,0.0,18.0
more significantly argues the report broadband is encouraging people to take more active role online,1.0,15.0
it found that one in five post something on the net everyday ranging from comments or opinions on sites to uploading photographs,0.0,22.0
broadband is putting the me in media as it shifts power from institutions and into the hands of the individual said john craig co-author of the demos report,0.0,28.0
from self-diagnosis to online education broadband creates social innovation that moves the debate beyond simple questions of access and speed,0.0,20.0
the demos report entitled broadband britain the end of asymmetry was commissioned by net provider aol,1.0,16.0
broadband is moving the perception of the internet as piece of technology to an integral part of home life in the uk said karen thomson chief executive of aol uk with many people spending time on their computers as automatically as they might switch on the television or radio,0.0,49.0
"according to analysts nielsen netratings more than 50 of the 22.8 million uk net users regularly accessing the web from home each month are logging on at high speed they spend twice as long online than people on dial-up connections viewing an average of 1,444 pages per month",0.0,48.0
the popularity of fast net access is growing partly fuelled by fierce competition over prices and services,0.0,17.0
savvy searchers fail to spot ads,0.0,6.0
internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests report into search habits,1.0,17.0
the report by the us pew research center reveals that 87 of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using search engine,1.0,24.0
it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones,0.0,15.0
the report reveals that 84 of net users say they regularly use google ask jeeves msn and yahoo when online,0.0,20.0
almost 50 of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden,1.0,25.0
according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt,0.0,30.0
significant chunk of net users 36 carry out search at least weekly and 29 of those asked only look every few weeks,0.0,22.0
for 44 of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find,0.0,26.0
search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it,0.0,25.0
according to pew research 44 of searchers use just single search engine 48 use two or three and small number consult more than three sites,0.0,25.0
tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query,1.0,38.0
despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes,1.0,20.0
small number 17 said they wouldn really miss search engines if they did not exist,1.0,15.0
the remaining 33 said they could not live without search sites,0.0,11.0
more than two-thirds of those questioned 68 said they thought that the results they were presented with were fair and unbiased selection of the information on topic that can be found on the net,0.0,34.0
alongside the growing sophistication of net users is lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web,1.0,28.0
of those asked 62 were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out search,0.0,22.0
only 18 of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not,0.0,18.0
said the pew report this finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results,1.0,35.0
commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference,0.0,31.0
tv future down the phone line,0.0,6.0
internet tv has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now,1.0,17.0
but any early attempts to do it the uk home choice started in 1992 were thwarted by the lack of fast network,0.0,22.0
now that broadband networks are bedding down and it is becoming essential for millions the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line,0.0,26.0
in the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls they are keen to be the top iptv dogs,1.0,21.0
software giant microsoft thinks iptv internet protocol tv is the future of television and it sits neatly with its vision of the connected entertainment experience,1.0,25.0
telcos have been wanting to do video for long time ed graczyk director of marketing for microsoft iptv told the bbc news website,1.0,23.0
the challenge has been the broadband network and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to feasible solution,0.0,25.0
compression technology was not efficient enough the net was not good enough,0.0,12.0
lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it reality,0.0,14.0
last year he said was all about deal making and partnering up shaping the iptv ecosystem,1.0,16.0
this year those deals will start to play out and more services will come online,0.0,15.0
2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america and other parts of asia it will expand he added,0.0,32.0
what telcos really want to do is to send the triple-play of video voice and data down one single line be it cable or dsl digital subscriber line,1.0,28.0
some are talking about quadruple play too with mobile services added into the mix,0.0,14.0
it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators,0.0,15.0
according to technology analysts tdg research there will be 20 million subscribers to iptv services in under six years,1.0,19.0
key to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data whenever viewer wants it is that it uses the same technology as the internet,1.0,30.0
it means there is not just one-way relationship between the viewer and the broadcaster,0.0,14.0
this allows for more dvd-like interactivity limitless storage and broadcast space bespoke channel playlists and thousands of hours of programmes or films at viewer fingertips,0.0,25.0
it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller niche or localised audiences sending films to bollywood fans for instance as well as individual devices,0.0,24.0
operators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer bypassing the need for special broadcast receiver,0.0,17.0
perhaps most compelling yet some might say insignificant is instantaneous channel flicking,0.0,12.0
currently there is delay when you try to do this on satellite cable or freeview,0.0,15.0
with iptv the speed is 15 milliseconds,1.0,7.0
that gets rounds of applause according to mr graczyk,0.0,9.0
microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago,1.0,14.0
we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future but that is several years away said mr graczyk,1.0,23.0
as with music tv has moved to digital formats,0.0,9.0
the things software can do to integrate media into devices means whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv to the mobile to the gaming console and so on,0.0,34.0
the company intends its microsoft iptv edition software an end-to-end management and delivery platform to let telcos to do exactly that seamlessly,1.0,22.0
it has netted seven major telcos as customers representing potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers,0.0,17.0
its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date said mr graczyk,1.0,17.0
iptv is about more than telcos though,1.0,7.0
there are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net power,0.0,21.0
jeremy allaire chief of brightcove told the bbc news website that it would be flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as channel,1.0,25.0
it is not just niches but about exploiting content not usually viewed he said,0.0,14.0
we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content and who often see unencumbered distribution,0.0,22.0

making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money an industry conference has been told,1.0,19.0
sony microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual e3 games expo in los angeles in may,0.0,20.0
these so-called next generation machines will be faster than current consoles and capable of displaying much higher-quality visuals,0.0,18.0
for gamers this should make for better more immersive games,0.0,10.0
in pre-recorded video slot during microsoft keynote address at the game developers conference held last week in san francisco famed director james cameron revealed he is making game in tandem with his next film believed to be battle angel alita,1.0,40.0
the game visual quality would be like lucid dream said mr cameron,1.0,12.0
but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop,1.0,25.0
the first new console microsoft xbox is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005,0.0,18.0
games typically take at least 18 months to create however so developers are grappling with the hardware today,0.0,18.0
according to robert walsh head of brisbane-based game developer krome studios next generation games will cost between 10-25m to make with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete title,1.0,33.0
such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start new game studio said mr walsh,1.0,17.0
if you re start-up doubt that publisher is going to walk in and give you cheque for 10m however good you are he said,0.0,24.0
mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games,1.0,34.0
one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright the creator of the best-selling the sims games,0.0,20.0
the founder of california maxis studio surprised the conference with world exclusive preview of his next game spore,1.0,18.0
spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures,0.0,12.0

eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities trading and fighting and even building space ships,0.0,17.0
advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players,0.0,14.0
these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet,0.0,9.0
mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game,1.0,20.0
don want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins want them to be george lucas or dr seuss explained mr wright,0.0,27.0
few games have hinted at the scope of spore but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers,1.0,26.0
instead of employing lots of artists to create 3d models of the digital creatures spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers,0.0,27.0
the thing am coming away with from the conference is that next generation content is going to be really expensive and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market said mr wright,1.0,35.0
like to offer an alternative to that,0.0,7.0
new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference,1.0,24.0

bt program to beat dialler scams,0.0,6.0
bt is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams which can cost dial-up net users thousands,1.0,18.0
from may dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on user pre-approved list,1.0,22.0
inadvertently downloaded by surfers rogue diallers are programs which hijack modems and dial up premium rate number when users log on,1.0,21.0
thousands of uk dial-up users are believed to have been hit by the scam,0.0,14.0
"some people have faced phone bills of up to 2,000",0.0,10.0
bt modem protection program will check numbers that are dialled by computer and will block them if they have not been pre-approved such as national and net service provider numbers,0.0,30.0
icstis the uk premium rate services watchdog said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives,1.0,20.0
the initiatives are very welcome spokesperson from icstis told the bbc news website,0.0,13.0
we are very pleased to see they are putting into place new measures to protect consumers,0.0,16.0
the second initiative bt announced is an early warning system which will alert bt customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills,1.0,24.0
if bill rises substantially above its usual daily average or if call is made to suspect number text or voice alert will be sent to the user landline phone,0.0,29.0
as part of the clamp-down on rogue diallers companies must now satisfy stringent conditions including clear terms and conditions information about how to delete diallers and responsibility for customer refunds,0.0,30.0
any firm running dialler without permission can now be closed down by icstis,0.0,13.0
the watchdog brought in the action last october following decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services,1.0,23.0
there are legitimate companies who offer services such as adult content sports results and music downloads by charging premium rate rather than by credit card bt said it had ploughed an enormous amount of effort into protecting people from the problem,1.0,41.0
"it has already barred more than 1,000 premium rate numbers and has tried to raise public awareness about the scams",1.0,20.0
we now want to ensure there are even stronger safeguards for our customers who we would urge to make use of these new options to protect themselves said gavin patterson group managing director for consumer the arm of bt,0.0,39.0

the business software alliance bsa warned that people should stay alert,0.0,11.0
many online consumers don consider the true motives of spammers said mike newton spokesperson for the bsa which commissioned the survey,0.0,21.0
by selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites spammers are hiding spyware without consumers knowledge,0.0,23.0

new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson,1.0,20.0
if it gets its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them,1.0,54.0
if the new law was about border controls defence or even the new constitution then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives,0.0,31.0
sadly for those who will be directly affected the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs topic that may excite the bloggers campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain,0.0,33.0
after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention,1.0,30.0
yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us,0.0,38.0
many observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement,1.0,27.0
it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideas,1.0,27.0
in the us you can not build system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless amazon lets you because they hold the patent on one-click online purchase,0.0,37.0
it is small invention but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it,1.0,17.0
we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long,0.0,16.0
the new proposals go back to 2002 although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s,1.0,25.0
they have come to head now after year in which proposals were made endorsed by the council of ministers radically modified by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form,0.0,32.0
some national governments seem to be aware of the problems,0.0,10.0
poland has rejected the proposal and germany main political parties have opposed it but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection,0.0,23.0
early in december the british government held consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals,0.0,17.0
science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position but according to those present it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned,0.0,35.0
the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an item and can only be approved or rejected,0.0,22.0
no discussion or amendment is allowed,0.0,6.0
so why should we be worried,0.0,6.0
first there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments,0.0,25.0
this goes to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried,1.0,23.0
if coders are treated like this today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow,0.0,18.0
more directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else patent,1.0,25.0
this is not about stealing software as code is already protected by copyright,0.0,13.0
patents are not copyright but something much stronger,0.0,8.0
patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately,1.0,21.0
have never to my shame managed to read lord byron childe harold pilgrimage,0.0,13.0
if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained substantial chunk of the poem then could defend myself in court by claiming that had simply made it up and it was coincidence,1.0,34.0
the same does not hold for patent,1.0,7.0
if sit down this afternoon and write brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files then am in trouble under patent law at least in the us,0.0,38.0
the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with legal environment that allows patents,1.0,36.0
they have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders,1.0,21.0
even this system breaks down of course as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer and other browsers infringed an eolas patent,0.0,33.0
that one was eventually thrown out but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars,0.0,16.0
but small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade,1.0,17.0
much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnu linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements,1.0,45.0
the damage to software will not happen overnight of course,0.0,10.0
if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products,1.0,30.0
eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large players,0.0,19.0
the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas,1.0,24.0
and it will damage europe computer industry,0.0,7.0
we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law,0.0,19.0

if you look at past oscar winners and nominees the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative epic-style pictures,0.0,22.0
fahrenheit 11 didn really fit in to that category,0.0,9.0
they tend to go for films like titanic gladiator and the lord of the rings films with scale that often aren too contentious he said,1.0,25.0

the biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these polls saying we are going to run away with the election,0.0,27.0
it might sound great but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and think that is the greater problem than iraq said nottingham city councillor brian parbutt,1.0,31.0

labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls,0.0,25.0
the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about people voting intentions,1.0,25.0
the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls,0.0,14.0

but that did not happen for voter identification calls,0.0,9.0
when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said,1.0,26.0

assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them,1.0,23.0
but classic market research such as poll of voter intentions did not constitute direct marketing he said,0.0,17.0
if party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with view to using this information in the future this should be clear to the voter concerned said mr jones,1.0,35.0
if party rings person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them the party may well be in breach of the regulations,1.0,35.0
in summary whether party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed,0.0,28.0
mr jones said the watchdog received very few complaints on the issue,0.0,12.0
earlier lib dem chairman matthew taylor wrote to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal,0.0,27.0

hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner,0.0,18.0
mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them,1.0,41.0

all the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run-up to the election after survey suggested first-time buyers could not afford home in 92 of uk towns,0.0,29.0
the lib dems say their mutual homes would let people buy share of property usually worth about of the building costs,1.0,21.0
party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land donated by central or local government,1.0,26.0
people would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land he added,1.0,19.0
they would spend about 30 of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property,1.0,18.0
when they moved house they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share,1.0,21.0
it would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account,1.0,25.0

this is typical of lib dem hypocrisy said tory shadow local government secretary caroline spelman,0.0,15.0
they claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market,0.0,34.0

"mr kennedy also believes the party plans to use the money saved from not introducing illiberal id cards to boost police numbers by 10,000 would appeal to women too",1.0,29.0

there is fundamental lack of trust in tony blair as prime minister and in his government he said,1.0,18.0

it was as always coded and careful but entirely deliberate was mr marr assessment,0.0,14.0
the prime minister was asked about mr brown article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio today programme,1.0,22.0
mr blair said decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor role would be central,1.0,23.0
mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was in part because of mr brown management of the economy,1.0,27.0
and he pledged childcare would be centrepiece of labour manifesto,0.0,10.0
he also predicted the next general election will be tough tough fight for new labour,0.0,15.0
but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about may,0.0,20.0
mr blair said he was taking nothing for granted ahead of the vote warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour majority instead of hoping for an outright win,1.0,42.0

will tory tax cuts lift spirits,0.0,6.0
michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts,1.0,14.0
should he win the next general election he has earmarked billion that will be used to reduce taxes although he still will not say which or how,1.0,27.0
this was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to,0.0,20.0
at its simplest it is saying vote tory and you can have it both ways,0.0,15.0
not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions,0.0,27.0
and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for tax cut equivalent to about penny off the basic rate of income tax,1.0,27.0
all the money would come from its 35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service,0.0,24.0
of that 23 billion would go on spending plans with billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cuts,1.0,29.0
neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although cut in the basic rate seems unlikely,0.0,23.0
ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election,1.0,31.0
as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up real economic policy divide between labour and the tories,0.0,23.0
at this election people will have clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he said,1.0,33.0
it is move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts,1.0,28.0
the extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters,1.0,27.0
and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes,0.0,34.0
he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he can not deliver if put into downing street,0.0,20.0
labour needless to say claim his planned 35bn efficiency savings simply don add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy,0.0,22.0
one of new labour greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy,0.0,28.0
so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug black hole it has at the centre of its finances,1.0,39.0
meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day,0.0,24.0
so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor,0.0,27.0
and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play major part in that campaign it is likely and the prime minister probably hopes that the economy will be the deciding factor,0.0,34.0

the proposals follow recommendation last year by elections watchdog the electoral commission,0.0,12.0
the government intends to legislate when parliamentary time allows to lower the age said mr leslie who was elected in 1997 at the age of 24,1.0,26.0
even if the move does go ahead it is unlikely it will be in place before the next general election widely predicted for may,0.0,24.0
the announcement from mr leslie who was elected in 1997 in formerly safe tory seat prompted calls for lowering of the voting age to 16,1.0,25.0
the votes at 16 alliance said it was good thing to engage people by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective,1.0,29.0
the voting age affects millions of younger people said spokesman alex folkes,1.0,12.0
we would hope that the government will table bill that is broad enough to allow for amendments to be brought to test support for reduction in the voting age,0.0,29.0
currently candidates in both local and national votes must be 21 while the voting age is 18,0.0,17.0
that is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place,1.0,27.0
irish republican bernadette devlin was one of just handful of 21-year-olds elected to parliament in the 20th century winning seat in 1969,0.0,22.0

last april report by the electoral commission said there was no strong argument for leaving the age for standing for election at 21,1.0,23.0
the commission found the most common approach around the world is for the voting age to be the same as the candidacy age,1.0,23.0
labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which for those just returned from the planet galifray is looming,1.0,28.0

those ad men really do earn their money,0.0,8.0
and coincidentally the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called fagin posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but as election supremo alan milburn declared are doing very good job,1.0,37.0
mr milburn in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards,1.0,42.0
not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days he declared,0.0,16.0
it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to choice between labour and the tories,1.0,19.0
nobody he claimed could picture liberal democrat leader charles kennedy walking up downing street the day after polling,0.0,18.0
they could however picture michael howard or of course tony blair doing it,1.0,13.0
so it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition policies and past record,0.0,18.0
and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign he said,1.0,15.0
between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of london than in it but in britain not overseas he promised,0.0,26.0

this is response to the concerns that have been voiced by local government about the pressures they face,0.0,18.0
mr raynsford also plans to make savings of 100m by making changes to local government pensions schemes,1.0,17.0
these would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early,0.0,23.0
he insisted the changes were very modest and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring very early,0.0,18.0
but general secretary of the public services union unison dave prentis criticised the plans,0.0,14.0
if you want world class public services you don get that by hitting people as they approach retirement,0.0,18.0
uk will stand firm on eu rebate,0.0,7.0
britain 3bn eu rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week european council summit jack straw said,1.0,18.0
the foreign secretary told mps the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 was entirely justified,0.0,16.0
new european commission president jose manuel barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the eu budget,1.0,22.0
mr straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation eu still had to see the light on the rebate,1.0,21.0
but the foreign secretary told the commons foreign affairs committee our position is very clear it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation,0.0,25.0
he added that he did not think there would be political price to pay for the uk stance britain contributed more and received less than other eu states,0.0,28.0
the two-day european council summit in brussels begins on 16 december and is widely expected to mark the beginning of lengthy negotiating period over the eu budget for 2007-13,0.0,29.0
the wrangling could stretch into 2005 even 2006,0.0,8.0
the uk france germany austria the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at of member states combined national incomes the commission wants it to be 1.26,0.0,30.0
mr straw said the eu commission proposal would mean 35 hike in the budget,1.0,14.0
don know of any national government thinking of increasing its budget by that amount he added,0.0,16.0
the foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce date in 2005 for the beginning of negotiations with turkey about possible eu membership although that there would be no prospect of date for joining for some time,1.0,40.0
chancellor gordon brown closest ally has denied suggestions there will be budget giveaway on 16 march,0.0,16.0
ed balls ex-chief economic adviser to the treasury said there would be no spending spree before polling day,1.0,18.0
but mr balls prospective labour mp said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules,1.0,17.0
he was speaking as sir digby jones cbi director general warned mr brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes,0.0,25.0
mr balls who stepped down from his treasury post to stand as labour candidate in the election had suggested that mr brown would meet his golden economic rule with margin to spare,1.0,32.0
he said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules,0.0,15.0
he also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour party chances of winning,1.0,22.0
expectations of rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising,0.0,15.0
consumer borrowing rose at near-record pace in january,0.0,8.0
if the mpc the bank of england monetary policy committee were to judge that rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy and not predicting that they will do not believe that this will be big election issue in britain for labour he told parliamentary lunch,1.0,52.0
this is big change in our political culture,0.0,8.0
during an interview with bbc radio today programme mr balls said he was sure mr brown budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy,1.0,27.0
don think we ll see pre-election spending spree we certainly did not see that before 2001 he said,0.0,18.0
his assurances came after sir digby jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers skills,1.0,23.0
his message to the chancellor was please don give it away in any form of electioneering,0.0,16.0
sir digby added don think he will,0.0,7.0
have to say he has been prudent chancellor right the way through,0.0,12.0
stability is the key word british business needs boring stability more than anything,0.0,13.0
we would say to him don increase your public spending don give it away,1.0,14.0
but if you are going to anywhere just add something to the competitiveness of britain put it into skilling our people,0.0,21.0
that would be good way to spend any excess,0.0,9.0
mr balls refused to say whether mr brown would remain as chancellor after the election amid speculation he will be offered the job of foreign secretary,1.0,26.0
think that gordon brown wants to be part of the successful labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off conservative party that will take britain backwards mr balls told today,1.0,39.0
prime minister tony blair has yet to name the date of the election but most pundits are betting on may,0.0,20.0
will the budget bring out smiling voters,0.0,7.0
as tory spokesman oliver letwin said any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners wouldn he,0.0,21.0
and everyone does indeed expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of may,0.0,22.0
there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways,0.0,18.0
but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put smile on voters faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election,1.0,37.0
and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week budget,0.0,24.0
the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories don desert him at the third poll,0.0,37.0
and needless to say there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after third win,1.0,35.0
but there is shadow hanging over this pre-election performance in the shape of 11 billion or thereabouts,0.0,17.0
that is the size of the financial black hole the tories backed by some independent forecasters believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election,1.0,29.0
the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash,1.0,34.0
it was immediately denied but the tories remain suspicious claiming that as mr letwin said if the money does not come from there where will it come from,0.0,28.0
mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election should labour win,1.0,27.0
previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong he will argue while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have sound economy low unemployment and high public spending,0.0,29.0
the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound increase spending and cut taxes at the same time,1.0,22.0
the liberal democrats will also promise to run sound economy but based on increased taxes to fund spending and amongst other things abolishing the council tax in favour of local income tax,1.0,32.0
and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies,0.0,24.0
but probably what that all boils down to is simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years,1.0,34.0
and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election,0.0,21.0
budget to set scene for election,0.0,6.0
gordon brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of labour bid for third term in power when he delivers his ninth budget at 1230 gmt,0.0,28.0
he is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability with low unemployment and interest rates,0.0,17.0
"the chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from 60,000",1.0,16.0
but the conservatives and lib dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under labour,0.0,16.0
treasury officials have said there will not be pre-election giveaway but mr brown is thought to have about 2bn to spare,0.0,21.0
"increase in the stamp duty threshold from 60,000",1.0,8.0
an extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families,1.0,9.0
possible help for pensioners the stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers likely theme of all three of the main parties general election manifestos,1.0,28.0
"ten years ago buyers had much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty with close to half million properties in england and wales alone selling for less than 60,000",0.0,28.0
since then average uk property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased,1.0,20.0
tax credits as result the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government tax take,1.0,19.0
"the liberal democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to 150,000 in february",1.0,17.0
the tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds with shadow chancellor oliver letwin branding stamp duty classic labour stealth tax,1.0,22.0
the tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if labour is returned to power,0.0,21.0
shadow treasury chief secretary george osborne said everyone who looks at the british economy at the moment says there has been sharp deterioration in the public finances that there is black hole he said,0.0,34.0
if labour is elected there will be very substantial tax increase in the budget after the election of the order of around 10bn,1.0,23.0
but mr brown former advisor ed balls now parliamentary hopeful said an examination of tory plans for the economy showed there would be 35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties,0.0,39.0
he added don accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments,0.0,23.0
for the lib dems david laws said the chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing he said,1.0,23.0
but lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in significant way,0.0,38.0
"snp leader alex salmond said his party would introduce 2,000 grant for first time buyers reduce corporation tax and introduce citizens pension free from means testing",0.0,26.0
plaid cymru economics spokesman adam price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to 5.60 an hour,0.0,28.0
labour may have abolished hunting but that didn stop chancellor gordon brown using his budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties core election foxes,1.0,28.0
specifically it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families,1.0,27.0
in relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre-election boost everyone had been predicting,0.0,24.0
so if you are couple with children pensioner patient or youngster there was something pulled from mr brown red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to new labour government,1.0,35.0
like surgeon he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign,0.0,25.0
the announcements brought great cheers from his own mps who are now in full-on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps,0.0,30.0
they obviously believed he had done that for them and coincidentally given his own image as prime minister-in-waiting another little boost,0.0,21.0
labour mps for example will undoubtedly now engage in debate over exactly how redistributive lovely old labour word this chancellor really is,1.0,22.0
but gordon brown is never going to put on show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win labour an historic third term his demeanour remained quiet confident and reassuring,0.0,37.0
prudence made an appearance albeit towards the end of his address as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to britain and which he claimed would be thrown away by anyone else,0.0,41.0
according to the opposition parties however it is all one big con trick,0.0,13.0
as always they accused him of glossing over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finances which they claim would ensure tax increases after the election,1.0,30.0
he did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the 2001 election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax,1.0,27.0
as liberal democrat leader charles kennedy claimed for most families the distinction between income tax and tax on income is meaningless,0.0,21.0
tory leader michael howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re-casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use,1.0,42.0
he branded it dodgy vote now pay later budget based on dodgy figures from dodgy government that gave britain the dodgy dossier,0.0,22.0
where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr brown forecasts to the prime minister forecasts on iraq weapons of mass destruction,0.0,31.0
as ever there will now be period of frantic activity by the opposition parties treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor red book which sets out the fine detail of his budget in an attempt to spot the flaws,0.0,40.0
in particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal,0.0,21.0
and in labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election,1.0,27.0
gordon brown has failed to tackle the fundamental unfairness in the tax system in his ninth budget charles kennedy has said,1.0,21.0
how was it right that the poorest 20 of society were still paying more as proportion of their income than the richest 20 the lib dem leader asked,0.0,28.0
the new 200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the unfair tax he added,1.0,17.0
the government could not go on patching up the system he added,0.0,12.0
speaking in the commons after mr brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last budget before the general election mr kennedy acknowledged that the uk was one of the most successful economies in the world,1.0,38.0
but he criticised both the chancellor and the tories for failing to address the ticking bomb of council tax revaluation,0.0,20.0
he said the recent experience of wales indicated seven million households in england would pay significantly more after revaluation,0.0,19.0
the chancellor announcement that he was to offer 200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely sticking plaster to much bigger problem,0.0,24.0
the lib dem plan for local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than 450 year with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off,1.0,34.0
on pensions mr kennedy said it was scandal that the system discriminated against women who had missed making national insurance payments when they were having children,1.0,26.0
he said residency criteria would end at stroke this fundamental iniquity,0.0,11.0
"mr kennedy added his party priorities of free long-term care for the elderly abolishing top-up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50 income tax to those earning more than 100,000 per annum",1.0,37.0
he contrasted his approach with mr brown pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax,1.0,15.0
the chancellor went on to put up national insurance contributions after the election,0.0,13.0
for most individuals most families most households it adds up to exactly the same thing said mr kennedy,0.0,18.0
and they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election,0.0,26.0
tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown budget as vote now pay later spending plans,0.0,16.0
the simple fact was that under new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug financial black hole mr howard said,1.0,24.0
everyone could see the chancellor sweeteners but these hid tax rises for hard working families he said,1.0,17.0
labour faltering election campaign would not be helped by the package of measures mr howard added,1.0,16.0
mr brown budget was not about what was good for the country but all about the interests of the labour party the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign,1.0,35.0
he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other,0.0,18.0
he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging millions of people in to the net to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax,0.0,26.0
we can all see the sweeteners but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins,0.0,22.0
he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced,0.0,18.0
their only answer is to tax to spend and to waste to get people to vote now and pay later,1.0,20.0
mr brown liked to rattle off magical balances conjured out of thin air in bid to convince people there was no black hole in the nation finances the tory leader said,1.0,31.0
this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers he said,0.0,20.0
you now propose to borrow over the next six years no less than 168 billion so much for prudence,0.0,19.0
the chancellor forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister forecasts of weapons of mass destruction,0.0,18.0
mr brown council tax rebate for pensioners was 300 less than what the tories were offering mr howard said,1.0,19.0
there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools,0.0,30.0
people would face clear choice at the election either more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives he said,1.0,28.0
that the battleground of this election,0.0,6.0
that what this election is going to be all about and say bring it on he concluded to loud tory cheering,0.0,21.0
thousands of civil service jobs have already been cut or moved out of london as part of major cost-cutting drive,1.0,20.0

mr brown also announced plans to merge 35 agencies into nine described by one civil service union as bonfire of the quangos,0.0,22.0
mark serwotka the leader of the public and commercial services union said in last year budget we had the day of the long knifes as the chancellor kicked off the crude game of who could cut the most civil service jobs between the government and the tories,1.0,47.0
there was time when the only worry thousands of hard working civil and public servants had on budget day was whether petrol or taxes would go up nowadays the worry is whether they will have job by the end of it,0.0,41.0
he said mr brown had made welcome announcements on closing tax loopholes and extending the new deal while cutting the very people who deliver them,0.0,25.0
the treasury also announced plans to reduce the number of public sector workers on sick leave with new system of checks and tougher measures against those suspected of abusing the system,0.0,31.0
brown calls for 5.5bn aids fund,0.0,6.0
gordon brown has called on rich nations to fund 5.5bn 10bn plan to fight the aids epidemic and find vaccine,1.0,20.0
on the fourth day of his six-day tour of africa the uk chancellor predicted vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges,0.0,28.0
doubling the 400m being spent yearly on finding such vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives mr brown said on thursday,1.0,26.0
he hopes to use the uk g8 presidency to push the issue forward,0.0,13.0
believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat cure and eradicate the world deadliest disease of today and today the world least curable disease hiv aids will rightly earn the title the great generation mr brown said in speech during his african tour,1.0,45.0
the problems of hiv aids were inseparable from poverty he added,0.0,11.0
at least 10 billion per annum 5.5bn is needed to address the hiv aids crisis in low and middle income countries,1.0,21.0
existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic,0.0,11.0
the uk proposal for an international finance facility is so important increasing world aid flows by over 50 billion 27bn,1.0,20.0
doubling of world aid to halve world poverty,0.0,8.0
mr brown also said he had agreed with the italian finance minister domenico siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease,1.0,30.0
currently the private sector was only spending 60m year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting mr brown said,1.0,21.0
he called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at cost of 20 each thereby boosting the market for inoculations,0.0,25.0
this would be large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms mr brown added,0.0,21.0
more must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with hiv aids and their families he said,0.0,22.0
but aid charity actionaid criticised mr brown preoccupation with finding vaccine and called on g8 nations to fund hiv aids treatments,1.0,21.0
the charity head of hiv aids in britain simon wright said while encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an hiv vaccine is important failure to provide any funding for hiv treatments condemns generation of people to death,1.0,37.0

uk heading wrong way says howard,0.0,6.0
tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said,1.0,19.0
britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message,1.0,16.0
mr blair government was bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added,0.0,18.0

mr howard also paid tribute to the nation character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster,0.0,18.0
the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said,1.0,20.0
we watched the scenes of destruction with sense of disbelief,0.0,10.0
the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp,0.0,16.0
yet britain response has shone light on our nation character,0.0,10.0
the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever,1.0,17.0
he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear,0.0,13.0

who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want,0.0,16.0
who can be trusted to get grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system,0.0,20.0
mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them,1.0,18.0
the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice,0.0,16.0
worst of all it is government that has wasted people money and failed to tackle the problems families face today,1.0,20.0
the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes,0.0,18.0
we can have progress without losing what makes britain great its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential,0.0,27.0
we simply need to change direction,0.0,6.0
the election will give britain the chance to change,1.0,9.0
this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account,1.0,23.0
but labour spokesman mr kemp said it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on april not january,1.0,21.0
let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment 15 interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax,1.0,28.0

the government must act quickly on the law lords ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful mary robinson has said,1.0,24.0

speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett resignation mr clarke said will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year,0.0,31.0
in the meantime we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords,0.0,30.0
mrs robinson said the law lords ruling was in line with international legal opinion and praised their very decisive eight to one majority,1.0,23.0
what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government but say that there had been disproportionate use that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn apply to british citizens she said,1.0,39.0
mrs robinson warned that lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg,1.0,29.0
if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords,1.0,41.0
she said meeting of the club of madrid group of former world leaders to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications,0.0,37.0
have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at both as very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles but also the response of the british government will be under quite clear international scrutiny there,0.0,40.0

civil rights group liberty said it exposed racism at the heart of the government asylum policy,1.0,16.0
the home office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone,0.0,12.0
it said it would look at the implications of the ruling but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because czechs are now entitled to free movement across europe,0.0,31.0

lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way only using more intrusive questioning if there was specific reason,1.0,25.0
liberty said statistics suggested roma czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by british immigration officials at prague airport than non-roma czechs,1.0,24.0

and that he wants to build better britain where everyone whatever the colour of their skin or religion can make the most of their talents,0.0,25.0
but the tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is outdated and unjust,0.0,15.0
it sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities he will argue,0.0,18.0
mr howard himself the son of immigrants will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the uk,1.0,17.0

figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29 of people aged between 18 and 24 and 19 of black voters were not on the electoral roll,1.0,26.0
young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form,0.0,24.0
odpm committee chairman andrew bennett said individual voter registration as opposed to registration by household should be quickly introduced as it could dramatically reduce the chances of fraud,1.0,28.0

mr chirac told reporters in brussels one can only have reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the british cheque,0.0,23.0
it can no longer be justified,0.0,6.0

shadow europe minister mr brady said believe it is essential that britain keeps the rebate and think it crucial test of how firmly the british government is prepared to stand up for britain internationally in europe,1.0,36.0
the uk is already one of the biggest net contributors to the eu,1.0,13.0
the foreign secretary meanwhile said the justice of the rebate remained,1.0,11.0
we have one of the lowest net receipts of any eu country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency,0.0,25.0
that continues to be the case,0.0,6.0

england will have to take on ireland in the six nations without captain and goal-kicker jonny wilkinson according to his newcastle boss rob andrew,1.0,24.0
wilkinson who had targeted the 27 february match for his international comeback has been missed by england not least for his goal-kicking,1.0,22.0
jonny not fit yet falcons chief andrew told bbc radio five live,1.0,12.0
he won be fit for dublin there no doubt about that but he might be fit for scotland and italy,0.0,20.0
the 25-year-old has not played for england since the 2003 world cup final after succession of injuries,1.0,17.0
england who have lost three six nations games in row wasted 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to france,0.0,20.0
goal-kickers charlie hodgson and olly barkley missed six penalty attempts and drop-goal between them,0.0,14.0
they ve probably got two of the best english kickers in the premiership in hodgson and barkley added andrew former england fly-half and goal-kicker,1.0,24.0
they re both pretty good kickers,0.0,6.0
charlie is good kicker week-in week-out,0.0,6.0
but it all about pressure and unfortunately england are just not handling the pressure at the moment,0.0,17.0
andrew also blamed england poor run of recent results on lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries,0.0,22.0
they just didn have that leadership that would have seen them through,0.0,12.0
martin johnson lawrence dallaglio and jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations he said,0.0,20.0
think it is really difficult for jason robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back,0.0,15.0
meanwhile former england full-back dusty hare put england mistakes down to lack of mental toughness,1.0,15.0
jonny wilkinson has proved himself cool customer with around an 80 kicking success rate hare told bbc radio five live,1.0,20.0
but natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do,0.0,14.0
you have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts,0.0,21.0
hodgson who has an excellent kicking record with club side sale sharks has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late,1.0,22.0
the top golfers don hit the fairway every time and it is the same with goal-kicking hare added,0.0,18.0
you need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over but great goal-kickers like jonny wilkinson come along very rarely,1.0,22.0
wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with six-try victory in rome,0.0,20.0
tries from jonathan thomas tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors 19-5 half-time advantage,0.0,15.0
luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory,1.0,21.0
fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year tournament,1.0,16.0
starting full of confidence after their victory over england the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes,0.0,19.0
diminutive wing shane williams fielded kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half,0.0,21.0
his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short the ball was switched left and michael owen long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in,0.0,33.0
stephen jones who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson heroics against england slotted an excellent conversion from wide out,0.0,20.0
wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute,1.0,24.0
henson sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england beat two players with ease out on the left touchline,0.0,23.0
but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner,0.0,26.0
with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum the home side forward power brought them back into it,0.0,22.0
but clever high kick from henson almost brought try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch,1.0,30.0
wales regained control with second try in the 21st minute henson lobbing up high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his 15th test try,1.0,32.0
jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with penalty attempt for italy,1.0,17.0
henson was also narrowly short with long-range effort at goal but wales ended the half with vital third score to give themselves some breathing space,0.0,25.0
henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post jones adding the conversion,1.0,31.0
italy who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with head knock before half-time built up head of steam on the resumption,0.0,19.0
de marigny landed penalty to make it 19-8 and nitoglia break through the middle threatened try only for the move to break down with knock-on,0.0,25.0
but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour,1.0,17.0
their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams who beat several players with ease and finished with powerful angled run from lock cockbain,1.0,29.0
before italy could recover from that blow strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over,1.0,27.0
with jones converting both for 33-8 lead wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter,0.0,21.0
the icing on the cake came with sixth try after more superb support work shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner,1.0,28.0
the only downside for wales was hamstring injury suffered by luscombe,1.0,11.0
but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years they will travel to paris in fortnight looking like genuine contenders,0.0,28.0

the world cup winner has been out of action since december having damaged both his shoulder and his foot,0.0,19.0
but tindall who recently signed for bath west-country rivals gloucester told rugby special he would be fit in time for the tour to new zealand,1.0,25.0
aiming to be fit by 18 april and hope can play from then he said,0.0,15.0
ve spoken to sir clive woodward and he understands the situation so just hope that can get on the tour,1.0,20.0
the 26-year-old will face stiff competition for those centre places from brian driscoll gordon arcy and gavin henson and is aware that competition is intense,0.0,25.0
but after missing out on the 2001 tour to australia with knee injury tindall says he will be happy just to have an opportunity to wear the red shirt,1.0,29.0
quite laid back about it to be honest it quite hard for me to expect to be pushing for test spot he said,0.0,23.0
but after what happened this season at least clive knows ll be 100 fresh,0.0,14.0
for the full interview with mike tindall tune into this sunday rugby special 2340 on bbc two,0.0,17.0

it horses for courses selection really said connor,1.0,8.0
there lot of competition here and can just drag my heels around if don get picked,0.0,16.0

missing the italian game was disappointing certainly but you can dwell on these things it part and parcel of rugby,0.0,20.0

rusedski won his service game but henman took the first of his three match points with service winner to secure his place in the second round at dubai for the first time in three years,1.0,35.0
it was the first match between the pair for three years henman last lost to rusedski six years ago and lasted two hours and 40 minutes,1.0,26.0

henman who now faces russian igor andreev in the last 16 admitted afterwards it was difficult coming up against his compatriot on fast surface,0.0,24.0

but he came back and that was good effort on his side,0.0,12.0
ljubicic was at loss to explain his poor showing in the first set,1.0,13.0

if there is positive sample then they should notify the international tennis federation itf as well as the national federation within three days he said,1.0,25.0
this is not the case here,0.0,6.0
as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials nor did the itf,0.0,17.0
today called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it,0.0,14.0

tim henman decision to quit davis cup tennis has left the british team with gargantuan void to fill,1.0,18.0
the world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament he has 36 from his 50 rubbers,0.0,26.0
and great britain last davis cup win without henman came against slovenia as far back as 1996,1.0,17.0
worse could follow according to former british team member chris bailey,0.0,11.0
bailey told bbc sport after tim announcement doubt greg rusedski will be that far behind him,0.0,16.0
but without their top two where does that leave british ambitions in the sport premier team event,0.0,17.0
captain jeremy bates has singled out alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as potential replacements,1.0,14.0
the yugoslavian-born bogdanovic though is 184 places below henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties winning one and losing the other,1.0,26.0
murray on the other hand is 407th in the current atp entry list and yet to make his cup debut,0.0,20.0
but bailey does see some hope for the future,1.0,9.0
he said now we ve dropped down to the euro-africa zone the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore,0.0,29.0
britain next opponents israel are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4-6 march match against likely trio of bogdanovic murray and the 187th-ranked arvind parmar,0.0,30.0
bailey said it will be tough for gb to move up but there comes time when our young players have to step up,1.0,23.0
this was always going to be inevitable with tim and greg growing years,0.0,13.0
wouldn lay money on us getting back into the world group next year but imagine in five years time we ll be competing for the major honours,0.0,27.0
of those lining up to replace henman the 17-year-old murray with four futures titles under his belt last year looks the best long-term bet,0.0,24.0
murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over tim mantle said bailey,1.0,14.0
he has an enormous amount of self-confidence judging by what he said in the past,0.0,15.0
bogdanovic three years murray senior has had more troubled time under britain davis cup umbrella,1.0,15.0
while murray has been marked out as britain golden boy bogdanovic was warned by the lawn tennis association for lack of drive at the end of 2003,1.0,27.0
and bailey said despite that alex is clearly talented as well while arvind is another contender,1.0,16.0
they re among the guys who have experienced the intensity of davis cup tennis whether as players or on the sidelines,1.0,21.0
the lta has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that,0.0,11.0
now they ll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup,0.0,14.0

the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low,1.0,13.0

the tags are combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by scanner each item contains unique identification number,0.0,21.0
more than half 55 of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases,1.0,27.0
fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties,1.0,23.0
ard jan vetham capgemini principal consultant on rfid said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology,1.0,28.0
acceptance of new technologies always has tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns,0.0,16.0
with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers the industry can reach this point,0.0,16.0

separate study by gartner has also said real-time tv broadcasts to mobiles is unlikely in europe until 2007,1.0,18.0

batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer like video playback video messaging megapixel cameras and games amongst others,0.0,22.0
bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life,0.0,19.0
fifty percent of europeans said the size of mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets,0.0,30.0
mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready said thomas husson mobile analyst at jupiter research,1.0,30.0

the service uses 3gp technology one of the standards for mobile tv,1.0,12.0
but at the end of 2004 the european telecommunications institute etsi formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld dvb-h as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe,1.0,26.0
operators will be working on the standard as way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles as well as trying to overcome several other barriers,0.0,24.0
the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed,0.0,15.0
handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard,0.0,12.0

people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens said gartner,1.0,16.0
digital video recorders like europe sky box and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch,1.0,21.0

civil liberties group the electronic frontier foundation eff has joined legal fight between three us online journalists and apple,1.0,19.0
apple wants the reporters to reveal 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products including the mac mini,0.0,21.0
the eff representing the reporters has asked california superior court to stop apple pursuing the sources,1.0,16.0
it argues that the journalists are protected by the american constitution,0.0,11.0
the eff says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press,0.0,12.0
apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named asteroid and has asked the journalists e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that,1.0,30.0
rather than confronting the issue of reporter privilege head-on apple is going to the journalist isps for his e-mails said eff lawyer kurt opsahl,1.0,24.0
this undermines fundamental first amendment right that protects all reporters,0.0,10.0
if the court lets apple get away with this and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose vital outlet for independent news analysis and commentary he said,0.0,44.0
the case began in december 2004 when apple asked local californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites appleinsider.com and powerpage.org,1.0,28.0
apple also sent requested information from the nfox.com the internet service provider of powerpage publisher jason o-grady,0.0,17.0
as well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines,0.0,37.0

dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision,1.0,17.0
the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago,0.0,17.0
macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most but not all of the current dvd ripping copying programs used to pirate dvds,1.0,23.0
ripguard is designed to reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer said the firm,1.0,19.0
macrovision said the new technology will work in nearly all current dvd players when applied to the discs but it did not specify how many machines could have problem with ripguard,1.0,31.0
some bbc news website users have expressed concerns that the new technology will mean that dvds will not work on pcs running the operating system linux,0.0,26.0
the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales,0.0,19.0
the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last 12 months taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download,0.0,30.0
ultimately we see ripguard dvd evolving beyond anti-piracy and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions interoperability in tomorrow digital home and the upcoming high-definition formats said steve weinstein executive vice president and general manager of macrovision entertainment technologies group,0.0,39.0
macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against rent rip and return where people would rent dvd copy it and then return the original,1.0,23.0
ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of 2005 the company said,0.0,17.0
the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs if used those programs will now most likely crash the company said,1.0,22.0
macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find way around the new anti-copying measures,0.0,18.0
millions buy mp3 players in us,0.0,6.0
one in 10 adult americans equivalent to 22 million people owns an mp3 player according to survey,1.0,17.0
study by the pew internet and american life project found that mp3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young americans,1.0,22.0
the survey did not interview teenagers but it is likely that millions of under-18s also have mp3 players,1.0,18.0
the american love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband,1.0,19.0
of the 22 million americans who own mp3 players 59 are men compared to 41 of women,1.0,17.0
"those on high income judged to be 75,000 39,000 or above are four times more likely to have players than those earning less than 30 000 15,000",0.0,27.0
broadband access plays big part in ownership too,0.0,8.0
almost quarter of those with broadband at home have players compared to of those who have dial-up access,0.0,18.0
mp3 players are still the gadget of choice for younger adults,1.0,11.0
almost one in five us citizens aged under 30 have one,0.0,11.0
this compares to 14 of those aged 30-39 and 14 of those aged 40-48,0.0,14.0
the influence of children also plays part,0.0,7.0
sixteen percent of parents living with children under 18 have digital players compared to of those who don,0.0,18.0

britons fed up with net service,0.0,6.0
survey conducted by pc pro magazine has revealed that many britons are unhappy with their internet service,1.0,17.0
they are fed up with slow speeds high prices and the level of customer service they receive,0.0,17.0
17 of readers have switched suppliers and further 16 are considering changing in the near future,0.0,16.0
it is particularly bad news for bt the uk biggest internet supplier with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining,1.0,24.0
"third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton editor of pc pro magazine",1.0,32.0
we expect these figures to leap in 2005,0.0,8.0
every month the prices drop and more and more people are trying to switch he said,1.0,16.0
the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription,1.0,27.0
some readers were offered price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator making it hardly worth while swapping,0.0,23.0
other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts,0.0,7.0
broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers,0.0,14.0
12 of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all,0.0,11.0
we discovered huge variety of problems but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier said tim danton editor of pc pro,1.0,35.0
this breaks the code of practice but because that code is voluntary there nothing we or ofcom can do to help he said,0.0,23.0

intel has said it has found way to put silicon-based laser on chip raising hopes of much faster networks,0.0,19.0
scientists at intel have overcome fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light,1.0,21.0
the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information,0.0,17.0
the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade,0.0,16.0
we ve overcome fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel photonics technology lab,0.0,15.0
writing in the journal nature dr paniccia and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang show how they have made continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors,0.0,38.0
currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it,1.0,33.0
telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved,0.0,32.0
we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia,0.0,19.0
while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances,1.0,39.0
this is despite the fact that silicon is much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables,1.0,25.0
this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips,0.0,17.0
dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material,1.0,27.0
it creates cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said,1.0,17.0
but the intel researchers have found way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into material that can both generate and amplify laser light,1.0,26.0
even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy-to-make filters be tuned across very wide range of frequencies,0.0,24.0
semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in narrow frequency ranges,0.0,13.0
the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it,0.0,24.0
dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses,1.0,33.0
it technical validation that it can work he said,0.0,9.0
eu software patent law faces axe,0.0,6.0
the european parliament has thrown out bill that would have allowed software to be patented,1.0,15.0
politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have chance of becoming law,1.0,24.0
during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped,1.0,13.0
the bill was backed by some hi-tech firms saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile,0.0,18.0
hugo lueders european director for public policy at comptia an umbrella organization for technology companies said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would european inventors prosper,0.0,27.0
he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents,1.0,25.0
other proponents of the bill said it was good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software,1.0,29.0
but opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement,0.0,30.0
the proposed law had troubled passage through the european parliament,0.0,10.0
its progress was delayed twice when polish meps rejected plans to adopt it,0.0,13.0
also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee juri said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of meps,0.0,26.0
to become law both the european parliament and qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill,1.0,23.0
the latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the eu for re-consideration,0.0,19.0

apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players,1.0,18.0
its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold 6gb compared to previous 4gb,1.0,23.0
the company which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped,1.0,26.0
30gb version has also been added to the ipod photo family,1.0,11.0
the latest models have longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of 40,0.0,18.0
the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design,1.0,22.0
during 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold 10 million of which were apple ipods,0.0,16.0
but analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the itunes online store which has given the company 70 share of the legal download music market,0.0,30.0
mike mcguire research director at analyst gartner told the bbc news website that apple had done good job in sealing off the market from competition so far,0.0,27.0

the unnamed woman from georgia says that chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not,0.0,23.0
the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001,1.0,19.0
hp the world biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit,0.0,12.0
hp ink cartridges use chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make change,1.0,21.0
but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty,0.0,20.0
the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render cartridge unusable through the use of built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer the suit said,0.0,33.0
the lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation,0.0,10.0
the cost of printer cartridges has been contentious issue in europe for the last 18 months,1.0,16.0
"the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as 34 but it could cost up to 1,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge study by computeractive magazine revealed last year",1.0,37.0

third-generation mobile 3g networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services,1.0,23.0
that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week,0.0,19.0
fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association,1.0,23.0
at 3gsm siemens showed off system that transmits faster mobile data,1.0,11.0
the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit second up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks,1.0,21.0
the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access high-speed high bandwidth technology available now,1.0,34.0
early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second mbps compared with less than 384 kilobits per second kbps on standard 3g networks,0.0,24.0
high-speed downlink packet access hsdpa sometimes called super 3g will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys,1.0,32.0
number of companies are developing the technology,0.0,7.0
nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access,0.0,20.0
the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers,0.0,15.0
while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to maximum of 14mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements,0.0,41.0
the typical average user rate in real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity when compared to basic wcdma 3g he added,0.0,40.0
motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using single hsdpa device,1.0,28.0
but some mobile operators are opting for technology called evolution data optimised ev-do,1.0,13.0
us operator sprint ordered broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year,1.0,17.0
we are expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprint vice president for technology development when the contract was announced,0.0,31.0
as part of 3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around 1bn on ev-do technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits second and peak download rates of 2.4mbps,0.0,41.0
mmo2 the uk-based operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on hsdpa,0.0,19.0
using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps,1.0,30.0
us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson,0.0,18.0
siemens plans for one gigabit network may be more than user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015 the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by factor of 10,1.0,59.0
siemens in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one,1.0,37.0
this enables data transmission such as sending big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band,0.0,30.0
the speeds offered by 3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences,1.0,20.0
but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dial-up phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits second much faster than 3g,0.0,31.0
this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up,0.0,15.0
if they aren those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators,0.0,33.0
but one gigabit second systems will not be available immediately,0.0,10.0
siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials,0.0,24.0
commercial system could be as far away as 2012 though siemens did not rule out an earlier date,0.0,18.0
the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month,0.0,18.0
but does the latest macintosh justify the hype,0.0,8.0
let us get few things dealt with at the outset yes the mac mini is really really small and yes it is another piece of inspired apple design,1.0,28.0
there is more to be said on the computer size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is just computer,1.0,24.0
inside that small box there is g4 processor cd dvd player hard drive some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system,0.0,23.0
dvd burner wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost,0.0,12.0
and if you do not have monitor keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also,0.0,18.0
it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under 400 you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications apple software,0.0,25.0
the mac mini comes bundled with mac os the operating system as well as ilife 05 suite of software which includes itunes web browser safari iphoto garage band and idvd,1.0,30.0
doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with better suite of programs than mac os,0.0,19.0
of course users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs,0.0,16.0
for people who want to do interesting things with their music photos and home movies then mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to main computer,1.0,28.0
it good little machine with reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses said mark sparrow technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine,0.0,38.0
he added in essence it laptop in biscuit tin minus the screen and the keyboard,0.0,15.0
the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look bit sick,0.0,16.0
the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically-savvy to experiment with their macs,0.0,18.0
one user has already created dock to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car,1.0,20.0
the small size of the machine makes it practical solution for in-car entertainment playing movies and music as well as navigation,0.0,21.0
another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via wireless keyboard and mouse,1.0,25.0
when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as sort of stealth media centre ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes music films and photos partly due to its small living room friendly design,0.0,41.0
but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case at least not in the here and now the hard drive at 80gb for the larger model is too small to be realistically used as media centre,0.0,38.0
while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than 80gb hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content,0.0,25.0
media centre computer has to store music files and photos and as such 80gb just seems too small,1.0,18.0
most pcs running windows media center have at least 120gb hard disks,0.0,12.0
coupled with the lack of tv tuner card digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is not what it is not,1.0,38.0
but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses,1.0,17.0
so is the mac mini just another computer or revolution in computing,1.0,12.0
graham barlow editor of mac format understandably has rather partisan viewpoint,0.0,11.0
it just mac but we should be very excited it revolutionary in its size smaller than pcs looks looks better than pcs and the fact that it the first mac designed to really go for the low-cost pc market,1.0,39.0
the design of the mac mini is further evidence of future when pcs are more than just bland bulky boxes,1.0,20.0
there are number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on mini-itx motherboards,0.0,14.0
but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home-build enthusiast or expensive pre-built options based around microsoft media center software,0.0,24.0
but for the value the mac mini offers bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before apple is to be congratulated,1.0,28.0
let us say then that if the mac mini is not fully fledged revolution it is mini revolution,1.0,18.0
yahoo has reached the grand old age of 10 and in internet years that is long time,1.0,17.0
for many yahoo remains synonymous with the internet veteran that managed to ride the dot-com wave and the subsequent crash and maintain itself as one of the web top brands,0.0,30.0
but for others there is another newer net icon threatening to overshadow yahoo in the post dot-com world google,0.0,19.0
the veteran and the upstart have plenty in common yahoo was the first internet firm to offer initial public shares and google was arguably the most watched ipo initial public offering of the post-dot-com era,0.0,35.0
both began life as search engines although in 2000 when yahoo chose google to power its search facility while it concentrated on its web portal business it was very much yahoo that commanded press attention,1.0,35.0
in recent years the column inches have stacked up in google favour as the search engine also diversifies with the launch of services such as gmail its shopping channel froogle and google news,0.0,33.0
for jupiter analyst olivier beauvillain yahoo initial decision to put its investment on search on hold was an error,0.0,19.0
yahoo was busy building portal and while it was good to diversify they made big mistake in outsourcing search to google he said they thought google would just be technology provider but it has become portal in its own right and direct competitor he added,1.0,45.0
he believes yahoo failed to see how crucial search would become to internet users something it has rediscovered in recent years,1.0,21.0
it is interesting that in these last few years it has refocused on search following the success of google he said,1.0,21.0
but for allen weiner research director at analyst firm gartner and someone who has followed yahoo progress since the early years the future of search is not going to be purely about the technology powering it,0.0,36.0
search technology is valuable but the next generation of search is going to be about premium content and the interface that users have to that content he said,0.0,28.0
he believes the rivalry between google and yahoo is overblown and instead thinks the real battle is going to be between yahoo and msn,1.0,24.0
it is battle that yahoo is currently winning he believes,1.0,10.0
microsoft has amazing assets including software capability and global name but it has yet to show me it can create rival product to yahoo he said,1.0,26.0
he is convinced yahoo remains the single most important brand on the world wide web,1.0,15.0
believe yahoo is the seminal brand on the web,1.0,9.0
if you are looking for text book definition of web portal then yahoo is it he said,1.0,17.0
it has achieved this dominance mr weiner believes by canny combination of acquisitions such as that of inktomi and overture and by avoiding direct involvement in either content creation or internet access,0.0,32.0
that is not to say that yahoo hasn had its dark days,0.0,12.0
when the dot-com bubble burst it lost one-third of its revenue in single year bore succession of losses and saw its market value fall from peak of 120bn to 4.6bn at one point,0.0,33.0
crucial to its survival was the decision to replace chief executive tim koogle with terry semel in may 2001 thinks mr weiner,0.0,22.0
his business savvy coupled with the technical genius of founder jerry yang has proved winning combination he says,0.0,18.0
so as the internet giant emerges from its first decade as survivor how will it fare as it enters its teenage years,0.0,22.0
the game is theirs to lose and msn is the only one that stands in the way of yahoo domination predicted mr weiner,0.0,23.0
nick hazel yahoo head of consumer services in the uk thinks the fact that yahoo has grown up with the first wave of the internet generation will stand it in good stead,1.0,32.0
search will be key focus as will making yahoo messenger available on mobiles forging new broadband partnerships such as that with bt in the uk and continuing to provide range of services beyond the desktop he says,0.0,37.0
mr weiner thinks yahoo vision of becoming the ultimate gateway to the web will move increasing towards movies and television as more and more people get broadband access,0.0,28.0
it will spread its portal wings to expand into rich media he predicts,0.0,13.0
looks and music to drive mobiles,0.0,6.0
mobile phones are still enjoying boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner,0.0,16.0
more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date,0.0,19.0
the figure was 30 more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said,0.0,17.0
good design and the look of mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005 said analysts,1.0,28.0
although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing slow-down in replacement sales,0.0,24.0
all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website,0.0,26.0
japan is where north america and western european markets can be in couple of years time,0.0,16.0
they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones,0.0,23.0
but there could be slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology,1.0,28.0
this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see compelling reason to upgrade said gartner,1.0,26.0
third generation mobiles 3g with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen,1.0,37.0
at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don really care about technology the speed of data to phone is not critical,0.0,37.0
nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own,1.0,22.0
the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms,0.0,24.0
more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services,1.0,20.0
the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005 she added,0.0,21.0
this was not women thing she said but desire from men and women to have gadget that is form of self-expression too,0.0,22.0
it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner,1.0,17.0
western europe has always been market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi,0.0,15.0
people are after something that is nice-looking and together with that there is the entertainment side,0.0,16.0
this year music will have part to play in this,0.0,10.0
the market for full-track music downloads was worth just 20 million 10.5 million in 2004 but is set to be worth 1.8 billion 94 million by 2009 according to juniper research,0.0,31.0
sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the w800 which combines digital music player with up to 30 hours battery life and two megapixel camera,1.0,27.0
in july last year motorola and apple announced version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones,1.0,26.0
apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola standard music application for its music phones,1.0,17.0
but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod,1.0,24.0
ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives,1.0,16.0
but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life,0.0,31.0

it plans to add more paid services with forthcoming launches of video conferencing voice mail and skype in service which would allow users to receive phone calls from landlines and mobiles,1.0,31.0
london-based software developer connectotel has unveiled software that will expand the sms functions of skype allowing users to send text messages to mobile phones from the service,0.0,27.0
broadreach networks has around two million users and hotspots in places such as virgin megastores the travelodge chain of hotels and all london major rail terminals,0.0,26.0

domain system opens door to scams,0.0,6.0
system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open back door for scammers trade body has warned,1.0,23.0
the internationalised domain names system has been work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force,1.0,23.0
but the uk internet forum ukif is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily,1.0,19.0
the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language,0.0,11.0
registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become whole lot easier for determined scammers says stephen dyer director of ukif,1.0,37.0
domain names are the real language addresses of websites rather than their internet protocol address which is series of numbers,0.0,20.0
they are used so people can more easily navigate the web,0.0,11.0
so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages hybrid of system called unicode is used,1.0,20.0
so for example website paypal could now be coded using mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet,0.0,19.0
the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as russian look just like an english,1.0,22.0
but the computer code would be different and the site it would lead users to could be fake,1.0,18.0
this is more than just theory,0.0,6.0
fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name idn system said mr dyer,1.0,28.0
as the idea was to prove point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets worrying precedent mr dyer said,1.0,29.0
although the idn problem is well known in technical circles the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked said mr dyer,0.0,26.0
it is important to alert users that there is new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like perfectly genuine site he added,0.0,28.0
for instance browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as warning to users,0.0,20.0
mr dyer acknowledged that it would be huge undertaking to update all the world browsers,0.0,15.0
another solution to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be case of throwing out the baby with the bath water he said,0.0,20.0
centr the council of european national top level domain registries agrees,0.0,11.0
rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world the organisation said in statement,0.0,34.0

no re-draft for eu patent law,0.0,6.0
proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission ec despite requests by meps,1.0,19.0
the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for year,0.0,12.0
some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms,0.0,20.0
the ec says the council of ministers will adopt draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review all aspects of the directive,1.0,27.0
the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention,0.0,23.0
in letter ec president jos 233 manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament josep borrell that the commission did not intend to refer new proposal to the parliament and the council of ministers as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004,0.0,47.0
if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for second reading at the european parliament,1.0,20.0
but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive,1.0,23.0
most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law,1.0,19.0
french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament request it would be an insult to the assembly,0.0,25.0
he said that the parliament would then reject the council version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure,0.0,26.0
in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted,0.0,14.0
this means that the us-based amazon.com holds patent for its one-click shopping service for example,0.0,15.0
critics are concerned that the directive could lead to similar model happening in europe,0.0,14.0
this they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court,0.0,31.0
supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us,1.0,24.0
ultra high speed wi-fi connections moved closer to reality on thursday when intel said it would list standards for the technology later this year,0.0,24.0
intel is developing ultra-wideband technology uwb which would allow fast data transfer but with low power needs,1.0,17.0
uwb is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless usb devices which need low power consumption,1.0,28.0
rival uwb standard is being developed by motorola and chip firm freescale,0.0,12.0
at the mobile phone conference 3gsm in cannes last month samsung demonstrated phone using uwb technology from freescale,1.0,18.0
at press conference on thursday intel announced that two uwb groups wimedia alliance and multi-band ofdm alliance had merged to support the technology,1.0,23.0
uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances,0.0,16.0
one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home,0.0,35.0
the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second,0.0,14.0
consumer electronics companies want uwb to replace cables and simplify set-up jeff ravencraft technology strategist at intel and chairman of the wireless usb promoter group told technology site zdnet,1.0,29.0
thirty percent of consumer electronics returns are because the consumer couldn set up the equipment,0.0,15.0
the first products using uwb technology from intel are due to hit the market later this year,1.0,17.0
initially they will be products using wireless usb 2.0 connections,0.0,10.0
uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let person gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves,0.0,22.0
the technology works over range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data,0.0,21.0
intel says the benefit of uwb is that it does not interfere with other wi-fi technologies already in use such as wi-fi wimax and mobile phone networks,1.0,27.0

survey of wi-fi networks in london frankfurt new york and san francisco by rsa security found more than third had basic security features turned off,1.0,25.0
by contrast last year survey found that 15 of firms had failed to take basic steps to improve security,1.0,19.0
rsa warned that wi-fi growing popularity made it much more likely that insecure networks would be found and exploited,0.0,19.0
wireless or wi-fi networks have become hugely popular over the last few years in offices because they are easy to set up and make going online much more convenient,0.0,29.0
this popularity shows no sign of slowing reveals the annual rsa security and netsurity survey which found an annual 66 growth rate in the number of wireless nets being installed in london and frankfurt,1.0,34.0
although most firms do take steps to turn on the security functions built in to the wi-fi standard and protect themselves from attack the survey found that significant proportion were taking unnecessary risks,1.0,33.0
on average 33 of the wireless networks found by rsa and netsurity researchers in london frankfurt new york and san francisco had not used basic security systems,1.0,27.0
many firms were simply turning on their wireless net access points and use default settings that anyone familiar with wi-fi could easily find out,0.0,24.0

game makers get xbox sneak peek,0.0,6.0
microsoft has given game makers glimpse of the new xbox console,1.0,11.0
some details of the xbox performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual game developers conference in the us,0.0,26.0
xbox frontman j. allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second,1.0,18.0
also all titles for the new xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games,1.0,29.0
microsoft is saving the official unveiling of the xbox codenamed xenon for the e3 show in may and the device could be on shop shelves by november,0.0,27.0
however during his keynote speech at gdc mr allard who heads development of game-making tools for the console gave glimpse into how some of its core software will work,0.0,29.0
he said gaming was entering high-definition era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the hdtv people were starting to watch as well as the hd dvds that will soon start to appear,0.0,37.0
industry watchers took this to mean that the xbox will push for hdtv quality graphics as standard as well as multi-channel audio to give gamers an authentic experience,0.0,28.0
mr allard said microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the xbox and for players to get playing,1.0,29.0
to this end microsoft was building in to xbox hardware systems to support headset chat buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games,0.0,30.0
the xbox would also support well-known industry specifications such as directx to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console,1.0,24.0
for gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware,0.0,30.0
this interface will hold details of player statistics and skill level on gamer card as well as give access to store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons such as new maps or vehicles for games they possess,0.0,47.0
this ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future said mr allard,1.0,17.0
only with such consistency would the xbox be able to support the 10-20 million subscribers that it was aiming for said mr allard,1.0,23.0

we want to be an entertainment facilitator he said on the opening day of the london conference,0.0,17.0
the bbc is also trialling service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non-licence fee payers overseas,0.0,24.0
the corporation interactive media player imp is its first foray into broadband tv known as iptv internet protocol tv,1.0,19.0
we see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers said bt andrew burke,0.0,24.0
with more people on broadband and connection speeds increasing telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it,0.0,23.0
increased competition between net service providers encouraged by ofcom has eroded bt position in the market,0.0,16.0
it is looking for good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over adsl reality,0.0,19.0
it also sees delivering tv over broadband as way of getting high-definition hd content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional regular broadcasts,1.0,29.0
the bbc imp has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in 2005,0.0,20.0
before it officially launches the bbc must show the government how it offers value for money,0.0,16.0
delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value says the bbc because it gives people more control and more choice,1.0,20.0
iptv is similar idea to voip services like skype,0.0,9.0
both use broadband net connections to carry information like video and voice in packets of data instead of conventional means,1.0,20.0
since it uses internet technology iptv could mean more choice of programmes more more interactivity tailored programming and more localised content outside of conventional satellite digital cable and terrestrial broadcasts,1.0,30.0
it is all part of the larger changing tv technology landscape and like personal digital video recorders pvrs gives people much more control over tv,1.0,25.0
broadcasters see iptv and pvrs as both as threat and an opportunity,0.0,12.0
the bbc recognises that tv over broadband is reality and aims to innovate with it said rahul chakkara controller of bbci 24 interactive tv services,1.0,25.0
the imp is based on peer-to-peer technology and lets people download programmes the bbc owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast,0.0,25.0
iptv enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times said mr chakkara,0.0,17.0
so we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for via the licence fee they can access it any time they want,0.0,24.0
it helps said mr burke that people are more au fait with terms like digital interactive now that digital tv reaches more than 56 of uk homes,1.0,27.0
according to benoit joly from broadband telecoms firm thales 30 of europe can not get satellite tv or digital tv,1.0,20.0
analysts say that iptv will account for 10 of the digital tv market in europe alone by the end of the decade,1.0,22.0
what needs to happen now agree analysts is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service 20mbps connections would be ideal,0.0,24.0
bt does not see itself as broadcaster of iptv services rather as an enabler said mr burke,1.0,17.0
its strategy is hybrid approach he explained where over-the-air conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband,0.0,17.0
initially appealing to niche markets like sports fans it will widen out,0.0,12.0
but iptv could be used for home-monitoring pet cams localised news services and local authority tv too says bt,1.0,19.0
it even suggests that it could target those households in the uk that do not own computer 40 of the country,0.0,21.0
broadband to them would not be about data and the net that could come later for them but about cheap phone calls and more choice of tv programmes,1.0,28.0
"home choice already offers 10,000 hours of shows and channels delivered over broadband to homes in london",0.0,17.0
with broadband net subscription you can also get your tv and phone service,1.0,13.0
through content deals and partnerships it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues,0.0,26.0
"it aims to expand nationally but is seeing lot of success with what it offers its 15,000 subscribers now and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer",0.0,31.0

chip maker backs net phone calls,0.0,6.0
rich templeton the head of giant chip maker texas instruments has given his backing to the growing sector of voice over internet telephony voip,1.0,24.0
voip allows pc users and in some cases those with just broadband connection to make telephone calls via the net,1.0,20.0
mr templeton said voip would be the next major application to drive broadband connections into homes,1.0,16.0
internet service provider wanadoo has announced it is launching its own broadband telephony service in the uk,1.0,17.0
subscribers to wanadoo broadband service will be able to use the service to make free evening and weekend calls to any uk landline and free calls at any time to other wanadoo users,1.0,33.0
the service will cost an extra month and will come with free livebox the broadband hub which wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services,1.0,31.0
the secondary phone line will mean customers can have an extra home phone number and will also provide wireless internet access around the home,0.0,24.0
eventually the service will replace existing landline services as wanadoo goes head to head with bt,0.0,16.0
voice-over broadband is key trend across europe and is set to have dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry eric abensur wanadoo chief executive told the bbc news website,0.0,28.0
voice-over-packet is going to be the second killer application after broadband internet access he said,1.0,15.0
the world largest maker of chips for mobile phones believes the technology will grow rapidly from the relatively small user base it has currently,0.0,24.0
almost 83 million people have downloaded the software that powers the skype voip service according to the net telephony firm website,1.0,21.0
skype lets people make free calls to other skype users and also make low-cost calls to ordinary phone numbers,1.0,19.0
us firm vonage also offers voip service but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into broadband router to make calls,1.0,22.0
bill simmelink general manager of ti voip business said the technology would only take off when people were making net calls with the ease of making normal call,0.0,28.0
it not about the pipe if you will or the silicon per se it about the application he said,0.0,19.0
we want to communicate freely effortlessly and economically wherever we are,0.0,11.0
in sign that voip is seeping into the mainstream giant isp aol announced on tuesday that it had plans to launch net-based phone service for some of its members within the month,0.0,32.0
customers will continue to use their traditional phones but they will plug them into adapters connected to their broadband source rather than the jack provided by the telephone company,0.0,29.0
calls are received and placed just like on the old telephone network,0.0,12.0
we can help mass-market adoption of voip said aol chief executive jonathan miller,1.0,13.0

nintendo ds makes its euro debut,0.0,6.0
nintendo ds handheld game console has officially gone on sale in europe,1.0,12.0
many stores around the uk opened at midnight to let keen gamers get their hands on the device,0.0,18.0
the two-screen clamshell gadget costs 99 149 euros and 15 games are available for it at launch some featuring well-known characters such as super mario and rayman,0.0,27.0
the ds spearheads nintendo attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market,1.0,14.0
since going on sale in japan and the us at the end of 2004 nintendo has sold almost 4m ds consoles,0.0,21.0
part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the ds can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for nintendo gameboy advance handheld,1.0,28.0
games for the ds are expected to cost between 19 and 29,1.0,12.0
about 130 games for the ds are in development,1.0,9.0
as well as having two screens one of which is controlled by touch the ds also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless,1.0,27.0
download play option means ds owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns copy of particular game,1.0,22.0
other ds owners can also be sent text messages and drawings,0.0,11.0
nintendo is also planning to release media adapter for the handheld so it can play music and video,0.0,18.0
five virgin megastores and 150 game shops were expected to open early on friday morning to let people buy ds,1.0,20.0
we know that customers want it as soon as it released and that means the minute not the day said robert quinn game uk sales director,0.0,26.0
but nintendo will only have sole control of europe handheld gaming market for few weeks because soon sony is expected to release its psp console,0.0,25.0
although nintendo is aiming for younger players and the psp is more for older gamers it is likely that the two firms will be competing for many of the same customers,0.0,31.0
sony psp represents real threat to nintendo because of the huge number of playstation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget,0.0,27.0
the psp uses small discs for games can play music and movies without the need for add-ons and also supports short-range wireless play,0.0,23.0
when it goes on sale the psp is likely to cost between 130 and 200,0.0,15.0
slow start to speedy net services,0.0,6.0
faster broadband in the uk is becoming reality as more internet providers offer super-fast services,0.0,15.0
some lucky britons can already take advantage of uk online megabits per second service which was launched in november 2004,1.0,20.0
bt retail has announced that it will trial the same speed service with national rollout by year end,1.0,18.0
other service providers are expected to follow suit and glut of new voice and video services will follow,1.0,18.0
if the bandwidth is there then isps will buy it said jill finger research director at analyst firm idc,0.0,19.0
others will be watching bt retail trials which is initially for employees and later in the summer for customers with interest,0.0,21.0
for bt retail she said the super-fast service could be way of differentiating it from other players,1.0,17.0
it has been losing market share and this could be one way of gaining some of that back said ms finger,0.0,21.0
wanadoo is set to trial an 8mbps service in the summer and also plans to roll out unbundled services which means it takes over the network from bt which will provide speeds of up to 15mbps,1.0,36.0
there is no timetable for this at the moment,0.0,9.0
cable firms ntl and telewest are also bound to increase bandwidth at some time in the future and according to an ntl spokesman are in better position than bt in the long term,0.0,33.0
bt network is limited compared to that of cable,0.0,9.0
with all the other services coming on stream such as video on demand the question is will 8mbps be enough,1.0,20.0
special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control computer mouse more easily has been developed,1.0,16.0
the device uses similar steady cam technology found in camcorders to filter out shaking hand movements,0.0,16.0
people with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen,1.0,26.0
about three million britons have some sort of hand tremor condition said the uk national tremor foundation,1.0,17.0
using computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so we re delighted to hear that technology has been developed to address this problem said karen walsh from the uk national tremor foundation,1.0,38.0
most commonly associated with tremors is parkinson disease but they can also be caused by other conditions like essential tremor et,1.0,21.0
tremors more often affect older people but can hit all ages,0.0,11.0
et for example is genetic and can afflict people throughout their lives,0.0,12.0
the assistive mouse adapter ama is the brainchild of ibm researcher jim levine who developed the prototype after seeing his uncle who has parkinson disease struggle with mouse control,0.0,29.0
knew that there must be way to improve the situation for him and the millions of other tremor sufferers around the world including the elderly,0.0,25.0
the number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages and at the same time the need for computer access grows he said,1.0,25.0
computer users plug the device into pc and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is,1.0,19.0
it is also able to recognise multiple clicking on mouse button caused by shaky digits,0.0,15.0
ibm said it would partner up with small uk-based electronics firm montrose secam to produce the devices which will cost about 70,0.0,22.0
james cosgrave one of the company directors said it would make big difference to those with tremors,0.0,17.0
pilot and my tremor condition has not limited my ability to fly plane he said,1.0,15.0
but using pc has proven almost impossible simply because everything revolves around using the mouse to accurately manipulate the tiny cursor on the screen,0.0,24.0
he said prototype of the gadget had transformed his life,0.0,10.0
the device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be barrier,1.0,18.0
last year the office for national statistics reported that for the first time more than half of all households in britain had home computer,0.0,24.0
with prices getting cheaper to get online too computer ownership is increasing,0.0,12.0

more than six million uk households now have broadband net,1.0,10.0
by the middle of 2005 it is estimated that 50 of all uk net users will be on broadband,0.0,19.0

the pirates with no profit motive,0.0,6.0
two men who were part of huge network of internet software pirates known as drink or die have been convicted at the old bailey,1.0,24.0
bbc news investigates how the network worked and what motivated those involved,0.0,12.0
they called themselves drink or die dod,0.0,7.0
they were network of computer buffs who derived pleasure from cracking codes protecting copyrighted software such as windows 95,0.0,19.0
they would then share it with each other,0.0,8.0
there is no suggestion any of them profited financially,0.0,9.0
but the authorities in both britain and the united states considered it software piracy and took dim view of networks such as dod one of number of so-called warez organisations operating on the internet,1.0,34.0
in october 2000 the us customs service began an investigation into dod and other networks such as razor 1911 risciso myth and popz,0.0,23.0
fourteen months later us customs co-ordinated series of raids across the globe as part of operation buccaneer,0.0,17.0
seventy search warrants were executed in the us britain australia norway sweden and finland,0.0,14.0
at least 60 people were arrested worldwide 45 of them in the us,1.0,13.0
among the leaders of the network were americans john sankus known by his internet nickname eriflleh hellfire spelt backwards richard berry kent kartadinata and christopher tresco who used server based at the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology mit,0.0,38.0
the longest jail sentence 46 months was handed down to sankus 28-year-old from philadelphia,0.0,14.0
us attorney paul mcnulty said at the time john sankus and his techno-gang operated in the faceless world of the internet and thought they would never be caught,1.0,28.0
these sentences and those to follow should send message to others entertaining similar beliefs of invincibility,0.0,16.0
but one man still in legal limbo is british-born australian hew raymond griffiths who is still fighting against extradition to the us,0.0,22.0
us customs claimed mr griffiths was one of dod leaders but his lawyer antony townsden told the bbc news website it was laughable suggestion and added he was living on welfare and had such an old computer that he couldn even download software,1.0,43.0
the allegation that he was the group co-leader is illusory,0.0,10.0
he had the least technical skills of anyone he couldn crack any codes and he has only been called leader because he was loudmouth who wrote lot on their messageboard,0.0,30.0
mr townsden said if he had committed any crimes he should be prosecuted in australia not the us,1.0,18.0
he claimed the australian government decision to accept the extradition request was typical of their current acquiescent attitude to the us,1.0,21.0
mr griffiths is expecting to hear this week the outcome of his appeal against the decision to extradite him,0.0,19.0
those involved would give themselves internet aliases which would act in the same way as tags used by graffiti artists,0.0,20.0
they could then brag about their code-cracking abilities without giving away their real identities,0.0,14.0
alex bell whose trial at the old bailey ended on friday was known as mr 2940 after computer device while his co-defendant steven dowd nickname curiously was tim,1.0,28.0
spokesman for us immigration customs and enforcement dean boyd said dod did not appear to be motivated by money,1.0,19.0
their motivation was the kudos which surrounded being able to crack sophisticated software,1.0,13.0
he told the bbc news website primarily they were just interested in how fast they could crack the code,0.0,19.0
it was all about underground notoriety,0.0,6.0
but mr boyd pointed out that once the software had been distributed on the internet it fell into the hands of organised criminals who were able to mass produce pirated software at zero cost,1.0,34.0
it cost us industries lot of money billions of dollars he said,1.0,12.0
mr boyd said it was truly global in scope,1.0,9.0
we raided number of universities including duke in north carolina and mit and found that several of the people involved were employed by major computer corporations,0.0,26.0
they would go home from work in the evenings and get involved in this warez culture,0.0,16.0
warez groups which began to surface in the early 1990s operate according to strict code of honour,0.0,17.0
for example if one group cracked the software first its rivals would respect that achievement and not seek to claim it themselves,0.0,22.0
mr boyd said the destruction of dod was great coup but he added not going to sit here and say we have sorted the problem,1.0,25.0
there are still hackers and people who do this for fun,0.0,11.0
internet piracy of computer software remains gigantic problem,1.0,8.0
spokesman for the business software alliance said dod members claim they did not profit at all,1.0,16.0
but they did profit by getting access to very expensive servers,0.0,11.0
he said dod and other warez groups were fostering culture of piracy on the internet,1.0,15.0
he said 29 of computer software in britain was believed to have been pirated and this cost 1bn in revenue for software companies their suppliers and distributors,1.0,27.0
it may seem like victimless crime but it touches more people than you might care to believe,0.0,17.0
apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products,1.0,17.0
the bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in december 2004 following online articles about apple asteroid product,0.0,20.0
now apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit,1.0,19.0
lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters,0.0,17.0
apple lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the asteroid music product and leaking them to the powerpage apple insider and think secret websites,1.0,26.0
all three are apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products,0.0,17.0

california has so-called shield laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest,0.0,25.0
the judge wrote it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of hits on website about apple have and will happen,0.0,21.0
but an interested public is not the same as the public interest,0.0,12.0
judge kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists too,1.0,29.0
the electronic frontier foundation which is acting as legal counsel for power page and apple insider said the ruling had potentially wide implications,1.0,23.0
anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling said eff lawyer kurt opsahl,0.0,20.0
mr opsahl said the eff was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and us federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent,1.0,41.0

more than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses,1.0,20.0
the huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than 100 networks of remotely-controlled machines,0.0,20.0
"the largest network of so-called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of 50,000 hijacked home computers",1.0,20.0
data was gathered using machines that looked innocent but which logged everything hackers did to them,0.0,16.0
the detailed look at zombie or bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the honeynet project group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as honey pots to attract hackers and gather information about how they work,1.0,43.0
while bot nets have been known about for some time estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely,1.0,22.0
to gather its information the german arm of the honeynet project created software tools to log what happened to the machines they put on the web,0.0,26.0
getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy,1.0,7.0
the longest time honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only few minutes,1.0,18.0
the shortest compromise time was only few seconds,0.0,8.0
the research found that once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on irc servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine,0.0,32.0
many well-known vulnerabilities in the windows operating system were exploited by bot net controllers to find and take over target machines,0.0,21.0
especially coveted were home pcs sitting on broadband connections that are never turned off,0.0,14.0
the months of surveillance revealed that the different bot nets which involve few hundred to tens of thousands of machines are used for variety of purposes,1.0,26.0
many are used as relays for spam to route unwanted adverts to pc users or as launch platforms for viruses,0.0,20.0
but the research team found that many are put to very different uses,0.0,13.0
during the monitoring period the team saw bot nets used to launch 226 distributed denial-of-service attacks on 99 separate targets,1.0,20.0
these attacks bombard websites with data in an attempt to overwhelm the target,0.0,13.0
using bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against,1.0,18.0
one ddos attack was used by one firm to knock its competitors offline,0.0,13.0
other bot nets were used to abuse the google adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine,1.0,21.0
some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games,0.0,12.0
criminals also seem to be starting to use bot nets for mass identity theft to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data,0.0,39.0

what price for trusted pc security,0.0,6.0
you can now buy trusted computers but can we really trust the pc vendors asks technology analyst bill thompson,0.0,19.0
if you have recently bought an ibm thinkvantage computer dell optiplex or one of whole range of laptops from toshiba hp compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised,0.0,36.0
inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module tpm that can be used for range of hardware-based security features,1.0,25.0
eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children toys,1.0,43.0
but for the moment it is separate piece of hardware providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them,1.0,22.0
and as part of well-designed network system it can provide lot more security than we enjoy today,1.0,17.0
big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware-based,0.0,10.0
at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure,0.0,16.0
it might be password-protected user accounts data encryption programs or firewall but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor,0.0,24.0
hardware security is less common even if it is lot safer,1.0,11.0
this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone smartcard than password but also because its more work for users systems administrators and managers,0.0,26.0
as result we settle for second best,0.0,7.0
so when it comes to computer security trusted systems could be major step forward,1.0,14.0
after all if you have laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run,0.0,32.0
and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded,0.0,22.0
at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems,1.0,14.0
instead you have to use special software like hp protecttools or wave systems embassy,0.0,14.0
this provides file encryption password management and identity protection usually for business users who connect to company networks,0.0,18.0
full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows longhorn,1.0,20.0
this will include what microsoft in typical act of obscurantism calls the next generation secure computing base and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware,1.0,29.0
when that happens we can expect to see lot of publicity around the new capabilities and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall,1.0,39.0
however there is downside to the increased security from viruses spyware and data theft that this will provide,0.0,18.0
because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management drm systems more secure this will give content providers lot more control over what we can do with music movies and books that we have bought from them,1.0,41.0
we have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences,0.0,18.0
users of apple itunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other itunes users great way of letting your mates discover your music collection,0.0,32.0
but the latest version of itunes limits this capability just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn selected playlist of purchased songs to cd,0.0,29.0
another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from real harmony service on your ipod,0.0,16.0
apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management,1.0,15.0
once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law,1.0,37.0
similarly users of tivo digital video recorders have found that they can not record some shows and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after day,0.0,28.0

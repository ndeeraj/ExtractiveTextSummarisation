why few targets are better than many,0.0,7.0
the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in 2000 were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world leading economy by 2010,1.0,35.0
but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige,1.0,12.0
for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesn become global economic laggard,1.0,15.0
they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia india and china as well as with the economic might of the united states,0.0,34.0
that why there was tone of urgency in the report out on wednesday by the former dutch prime minister wim kok,0.0,21.0
mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets five years on from their inception,1.0,31.0
his conclusion was simple too many of the targets will be seriously missed,0.0,13.0
lisbon risks becoming synonym for missed objectives and failed promises his report said,1.0,13.0
the status quo is not an option,0.0,7.0
at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built it said,0.0,22.0
the report comes at time when europe competitive position is waning,0.0,11.0
the eu economic growth rate is projected to be this year and 2.4 next,1.0,14.0
while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe productivity lags behind that of the us,0.0,18.0
but meeting the lisbon targets requires political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far,1.0,17.0
that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years,0.0,18.0
as mr kok report noted the ink had scarcely dried on the lisbon agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded,1.0,21.0
the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit,1.0,16.0
the circumstances weren conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in 2000,1.0,19.0
neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming so-called knowledge-based economy,0.0,29.0
the lisbon vision is compelling one but in order to do it society has to change said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council brussels-based citizen action group,1.0,27.0
what you find is that lot of people have been fighting change,0.0,12.0
you find trade unions fighting change,0.0,6.0
even though they tell you they re in favour of change many are actually pushing for less competition more subsidy and less free market activity,0.0,25.0
but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago,1.0,19.0
targets have habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case they covered too much according to the wim report,1.0,23.0
economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea,0.0,21.0
the agenda was just too broad and as result nothing was prioritised,0.0,12.0
lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing the kok report said,1.0,12.0
everybody is responsible and thus no one,0.0,7.0
that why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth,1.0,26.0
it also recommends that the european commission draw up league table which ranks countries according to the steps they re taking towards meeting the targets effectively naming shaming and faming,0.0,30.0
rhetoric and delivery don necessarily go hand in hand mr kok said in press conference alongside the publication of his report,0.0,21.0
we don have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another,0.0,13.0
on one point mr kok was very clear the european union should not try to emulate the us economy,1.0,19.0
the european economic and social model needs to change but not so much so that social and environmental issues take backseat to economic growth,1.0,24.0
in that sense the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters,0.0,11.0
the kok report tries to do away with belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth,1.0,21.0
it very ambitious said john palmer political director at the european policy centre brussels-based think-tank,0.0,15.0
this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do,0.0,14.0
it going to require quite new and innovative policies,0.0,9.0
but some analysts believe that the kok report doesn come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets reality,1.0,26.0
for example it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce,0.0,19.0
but it doesn say how companies should be convinced to do this,0.0,12.0
it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission jose manuel barroso to adopt mr kok recommendations and press them on eu governments,0.0,26.0
mr barroso has said that the eu competitiveness will be his top priority,0.0,13.0
he expects his five-year term in office to be judged on europe success in meeting the lisbon agenda,0.0,18.0
malaysia central bank is to relax restrictions on foreign ownership to encourage islamic banking,1.0,14.0

also on tuesday the central bank released growth figures showing malaysia economy expanded 7.1 in 2004,0.0,16.0
but growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter to 5.6 and the central bank said it expected expansion in 2005,0.0,20.0
malaysia changed the law to allow islamic banking in 1983,1.0,10.0

alfa romeos to get gm engines,0.0,6.0

the unions claim fiat is to close the fiat powertrain plant at arese near milan and instead source six-cylinder engines from general motors,1.0,23.0
fiat has yet to comment on the matter but the unions say the new engines will be made by gm in australia,1.0,22.0
the news comes week after gm pulled out of an agreement to buy fiat,0.0,14.0
gm had to pay former partner fiat 1.55bn euros 2bn 1.1bn to get out of deal which could have forced it to buy the italian carmaker outright,0.0,27.0
fiat and gm also ended their five-year alliance and two joint ventures in engines and purchasing but did agree to continue buying each other engines,0.0,25.0
powertrain told us today that alfa romeo engines will no longer be made in arese said union leader vincenzo lilliu as reported by the reuters news agency,1.0,27.0
the assembly line will be dismantled and the six-cylinder alfa romeo motor will be replaced with an engine gm produces in australia,1.0,22.0
reuters also said that mr lilliu and other union bosses shouted insults at fiat chairman luca di montezemolo following meeting on tuesday regarding the future of the arese plant,0.0,29.0

saab to build cadillacs in sweden,0.0,6.0
general motors the world largest car maker has confirmed that it will build new medium-sized cadillac bls at its loss-making saab factory in sweden,1.0,24.0
the car unveiled at the geneva motor show is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market,1.0,18.0
it will not be sold in the us said gm europe president carl-peter forster,1.0,14.0
as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers the car will be the first cadillac with diesel engine,1.0,24.0
gm announcement should go some way to allay fears of the saab factory closure,0.0,14.0
the factory in trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about gm planned severe cutbacks in its troubled european operations,0.0,21.0
but the group new commitment to the swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group opel workers in ruesselsheim germany,0.0,21.0
they may now have to face larger proportion of gm cuts,0.0,11.0
neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden since it reflects saab failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market,1.0,28.0
for years saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with bmw mercedes and jaguar,0.0,15.0
the segment leaders do not agree,0.0,6.0
gm plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers,1.0,25.0
in the us it has long been established as an upmarket brand even the presidential limousine carries the badge,0.0,19.0
yet it could prove tough for cadillac to steal market share from the majors in europe,0.0,16.0
other luxury car makers most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe,1.0,25.0
there german marques mercedes benz and bmw have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market,0.0,15.0
"bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the saab factory which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year",1.0,23.0
that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations and saab is losing money fast albeit with losses halved in 2004 to 200m 104m 151m euros from 500m the previous year,0.0,37.0
"beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its european operations gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs opels badged as vauxhalls in the uk and now cadillacs on the same framework and by allowing the different brands to share parts",0.0,42.0
another way to further reduce saab losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car,1.0,31.0
doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers,1.0,20.0
but not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward,0.0,15.0
we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today the chief executive of leading european car maker told bbc news,1.0,27.0
the current trend towards us production was stupid he said,0.0,10.0
in separate announcement gm unveiled new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models,0.0,21.0
"it is to deploy fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries inviting potential buyers to try out vehicle for 24-hours",0.0,21.0

through their cubic expression vehicle they own 28.9 of the club,0.0,11.0
joe mclean football specialist at accountancy firm grant thornton said the support of mr magnier and mr mcmanus was utterly crucial,1.0,21.0
mr glazer bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment,1.0,23.0
if that the case the shares will therefore need price attachment of about 300 pence maybe 305,0.0,17.0
if that the case then mr glazer might well secure their support if he does this bid could well go ahead,1.0,21.0
malcolm glazer was little-known in the uk until he started to build up his stake in manchester united in late 2003,1.0,21.0

and if you want to take part in the series go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch,0.0,25.0
working from home presents multitude of challenges,0.0,7.0
understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style,1.0,14.0
do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others,1.0,12.0
are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done,0.0,14.0
do you build on the ideas of others or are you more introspective problem solver,0.0,15.0
in order for virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential,1.0,17.0
it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours,0.0,20.0
referring to the space as work will give those around you clear message that this is professional space,1.0,18.0
it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining network,0.0,22.0
isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry,0.0,25.0
joining professional groups or forming loose association of like-minded people may assist,0.0,12.0
it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrected,0.0,35.0
prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight and the structure is checked for stability,1.0,27.0
it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing,1.0,12.0
ideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn,1.0,20.0
this would also allow for well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured,0.0,16.0
it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity,0.0,15.0
in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate,1.0,33.0
ideally it would be good to have mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities,0.0,20.0
the walls should be dry lined with single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in light colour,1.0,39.0
the owner mentions she might lay new floor over the existing planks this will improve the insulation and offer level surface,0.0,21.0
would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn,1.0,17.0
as for lighting consider combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights wall washers and selected downlights,1.0,16.0
use combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior,0.0,22.0
please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne barn,1.0,16.0
the layout of this office reflects the need to have working area and more relaxed meeting space,1.0,17.0
large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available,0.0,16.0
the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace,0.0,26.0
regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible,0.0,18.0
wireless router access point in the house with wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient,1.0,21.0
however important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in weak signal strength,0.0,32.0
you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area,1.0,12.0
your local it supplier will be able to advise on this,0.0,11.0
if you haven already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment,0.0,21.0
to really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider laptop computer and docking station with external mouse and monitor,0.0,20.0

as the aurora limped back to its dock on 20 january blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe,0.0,26.0
the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble,0.0,19.0
and its owner cruises now part of the huge us carnival corporation was looking at significant slice chopped off this year profits and potential pr fiasco,1.0,26.0
no-one however seems to have told the stock markets,0.0,9.0
the warning of five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival share price from 35 to 36.20,0.0,32.0
other investors barely blinked and by 1300 gmt carnival shares in london were down single penny or 0.03 at 32.26,0.0,20.0
why the mismatch between the public perception and the market response,0.0,11.0
the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time says deutsche bank simon champion,1.0,16.0
it was clearly source of uncertainty for the company it was long cruise after all,0.0,15.0
but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events,0.0,14.0
despite its string of bad luck he pointed out aurora is just one vessel in large carnival fleet the uk princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003,1.0,33.0
and generally speaking carnival has reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule,1.0,14.0
carnival has an incredibly strong track record mr champion,1.0,9.0
similarly analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited,1.0,15.0
the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both refund and credit for another cruise,0.0,32.0
that should mitigate some of the pr risk both for carnival and its main competitor royal caribbean,0.0,17.0
while not common cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in note to clients on friday,0.0,26.0
moreover such events typically have limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises,0.0,14.0
after all the aurora incident may be big news in the uk but for carnival customers elsewhere it unlikely to make too much of splash,1.0,25.0
assuming that citigroup is right and demand stays solid the structure of the industry also works in carnival favour,0.0,19.0
in the wake of princess takeover by carnival the business is now to great extent duopoly,1.0,16.0
given the expense of building outfitting and running cruise ship slowing supply growth is certainty said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday,0.0,23.0
in other words if you do want cruise your options are limited,1.0,12.0
and with carnival remaining the market leader it looks set to keep selling the tickets no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future,1.0,26.0
the ticking budget facing the us,0.0,6.0
the budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george bush are highly controversial,1.0,16.0
the washington-based economic policy institute which tends to be critical of the president looks at possible fault lines,0.0,18.0
us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for dose of shock therapy,1.0,15.0
without major changes in current policies and political prejudices the federal budget simply can not hold together,1.0,17.0
news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs,1.0,26.0
from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come,1.0,22.0
under direct threat will be the federal government ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund,1.0,21.0
as soon as 2018 the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits,0.0,24.0
the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt which will grow in 10 years by conservative estimates to more than half the nation total annual output,1.0,29.0
this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business,1.0,22.0
even now growing share of us borrowing is from abroad,1.0,10.0
the us government can not finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china among other nations,1.0,22.0
this does not bode well for us influence in the world,0.0,11.0
the decline of the dollar is warning sign that current economic trends can not continue,0.0,15.0
before too long credit markets are likely to react and interest rates will creep upwards,0.0,15.0
interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately sectors such as housing automobiles other consumer durables agriculture and small business,0.0,18.0
some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late 1970s,0.0,21.0
there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget,1.0,12.0
the public outcry will force congress to act,0.0,8.0
whether it will act wisely is another matter,0.0,8.0
by definition the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending but this neutral description doesn adequately capture the current situation,1.0,22.0
federal revenues are at 1950s levels while spending remains where it has been in recent decades much higher,1.0,18.0
in addition the united states has two significant military missions,0.0,10.0
the bush administration chosen remedy is the least feasible one,0.0,10.0
reducing domestic spending or eliminating waste fraud and abuse is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem,1.0,24.0
indeed if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spending left,1.0,21.0
law enforcement space exploration environmental clean-up economic development the small business administration housing veterans benefits aid to state and local governments would all but disappear,0.0,25.0
it fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed,0.0,11.0
the biggest spending growth areas are defence including homeland security and health care for the elderly and the poor,1.0,19.0
to some extent increases in these areas are inevitable,0.0,9.0
the us population is aging and the nation does face genuine threats in the world,1.0,15.0
but serious savings can only be found where the big money is,0.0,12.0
savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private,1.0,28.0
brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation elderly and indigent,1.0,14.0
on the revenue side the lion share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced,0.0,21.0
some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes,0.0,19.0
finally blind allegiance to balanced budget will have to be abandoned,0.0,11.0
there is no good reason to fixate on it anyway,0.0,10.0
moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely,0.0,11.0
borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense,0.0,15.0
the sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reforms can be pursued,0.0,13.0
first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts,0.0,25.0
second should be dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years much of it unrelated to afghanistan iraq or terrorism,0.0,26.0
third must be the start of serious debate on large-scale health care reform,0.0,13.0
one thing is certain destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century,1.0,29.0

the group is to set up new access services division with separate board which would include independent members to ensure equal access for rivals to the local loop the copper wires that run between telephone exchanges and households,0.0,38.0

in fact the markets are being perfectly rational,1.0,8.0
for start the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines,1.0,17.0
the overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance according to estimates from india only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies,0.0,41.0
indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates,0.0,9.0

more broadly the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact,0.0,17.0
according to the natural hazards research and applications information center at colorado state university there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by depression,0.0,25.0
the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity there is rarely the centre says any sort of rebuilding boom but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided,0.0,40.0
study of the 1993 des moines floods from the disaster research center at the university of delaware found that 70 of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster and another 18 felt themselves better off,1.0,37.0

it still too early for concrete damage figures swiss re spokesman floiran woest told associated press,0.0,16.0

the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of or more of the firm shares,0.0,20.0
marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the sec investigation,1.0,11.0
marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the new york attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market,1.0,18.0
since that inquiry was launched in october marsh has replaced its chief executive and held boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board,1.0,30.0
prosecutors allege that marsh the world biggest insurance broker and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover,1.0,21.0
this is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by new york top law officer eliot spitzer and separate prosecution of five insurers by the state of california,0.0,29.0
the sec investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the trident funds managed by mmc capital the company private equity firm,0.0,23.0
marsh new chief executive michael cherkasky is trying to negotiate settlement with mr spitzer,0.0,14.0
mr spitzer has built up reputation as fierce critic and campaigner against corporate america misdeeds,0.0,15.0
the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies standard poor moody and fitch to downgrade marsh in recent weeks,1.0,23.0
according to the financial times insurance analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year,0.0,35.0

could yukos be blessing in disguise,0.0,6.0
other things being equal the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for song ought to be bad for business,0.0,25.0
but in the looking-glass world of modern russia the opposite might just be true new report has argued,0.0,18.0
the study from the centre for economic policy research does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos,0.0,19.0
but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms even targets of the tax police,1.0,19.0
an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount of dividends and other income outside shareholders will receive even accounting for increased levels of taxation the authors say,1.0,28.0
the paper reasoning is complex and is based on sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company,1.0,31.0
the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable,1.0,27.0
in the west meanwhile higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues,0.0,15.0
on the other hand increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately,1.0,31.0
the net result the authors say is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness,1.0,26.0
after vladimir putin became president in 2000 he did not raise taxes but put lot of effort too much critics argue into enforcement,0.0,23.0
since then the russian stock market has more than trebled in value rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach,1.0,25.0
the report highlights the case of sibneft russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year,1.0,19.0
after mr putin came to power the company overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6 to 10.4 and sibneft was the target of series of aggressive raids by fiscal police,0.0,30.0
but shareholders benefited hugely sibneft started to pay dividends 53m in 2000 and almost 1bn in 2001 and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds,0.0,34.0
according to the authors although variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers,1.0,38.0
for all its faults corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000,1.0,15.0
companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards,0.0,31.0
foreign direct investment long negligible is starting to flow in serious amounts 7bn in 2003 and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe,0.0,26.0
but the authors model does not quite cover all the complexities,0.0,11.0
for start the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation companies want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue,0.0,23.0
in fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia connections often greased by bribery blur the apparently antagonistic relationship,0.0,23.0
companies can for example persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes,0.0,11.0
and the authors definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western,1.0,10.0
genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced,1.0,25.0
the case against yukos for example has moved in fits and starts with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed,0.0,35.0
as far as most commentators are concerned the state is pursuing yukos out of political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude,0.0,23.0
since yukos founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested year ago the russian market has dropped by 10 an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance,0.0,30.0

gifts of the financial variety might have longer lasting impact,0.0,10.0
it may encourage children to save or start fund which could count towards university costs for example,1.0,17.0
the government is trying to encourage saving at an early age through its new child trust fund,1.0,17.0
the first vouchers worth 250 or 500 for low-income families will be distributed from january,0.0,15.0
all children born after 1st september 2002 will be eligible,0.0,10.0
parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in april 2005,0.0,23.0
"parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to 1,200 year which will grow free of income and capital gains tax",1.0,26.0
as the child trust fund will not be in force in time for christmas relatives could invest their gifts in higher rate children deposit account and use this as feeder fund,1.0,31.0
there are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay higher rate of interest,1.0,20.0
some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the ladybird account from the saffron walden building society paying 5.35 for minimum balance of and the alliance leicester firstsaver which pays 5.25 also starting at,0.0,35.0
interest earned by children is subject to income tax,1.0,9.0
"however children like adults have personal income tax allowance 4,745 for the current tax year",0.0,15.0
if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives but not parents any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance,1.0,26.0
as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance then no tax will be payable,0.0,18.0
when the account is opened form r85 available from the bank or building society should be completed,0.0,17.0
this confirms that the account holder is non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax,1.0,20.0
the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of child,1.0,13.0
only 100 of interest per parent can be tax-free,1.0,9.0
where interest exceeds this level the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent,1.0,16.0
this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children names and taking advantage of the tax allowances,1.0,22.0
where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of child consideration should be given to opening separate accounts one for parents gifts and one for gifts from other relatives,1.0,31.0
"therefore it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual 1,200 limit being directed to deposit account",1.0,37.0
another favourite solution is premium bonds,0.0,6.0
with the promise of riches far greater than mere deposit account they make great presents,0.0,15.0
the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase,1.0,17.0
any prizes will be sent to the parent or child guardian,0.0,11.0
the minimum for each purchase is 100 and bonds are sold in multiples of 10,0.0,15.0
there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored,0.0,13.0
over the longer term stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment although in the shorter term they can be volatile,0.0,22.0
one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term more than ten years which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares,0.0,32.0
one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through unit or investment trust,0.0,18.0
these are pooled investment funds which give access to wide range of shares,0.0,13.0
these funds may be actively managed where fund manager picks individual stocks based on view of their future potential or passive where manager invests in all the shares that comprise stock market index for example the ftse 100,0.0,38.0
exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track stock market,0.0,11.0
these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index so are really another form of tracker,0.0,19.0
the difference is that the charges are quite low,0.0,9.0
the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18 and parents will have no control over how it is spent,1.0,32.0
for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income,0.0,26.0

the point of all this has been to convince europe decision makers that rather than being phenomenally costly exercise for the eu allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits,1.0,33.0
the cake will be bigger for everybody said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month,0.0,16.0
turkey will not be burden for the eu budget,1.0,9.0
if admitted into the eu turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros 8bn 6bn to its budget by 2014 according to recent impact study by the country state planning organisation,1.0,29.0
as turkey gross domestic output gdp is set to grow by per year on average its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020,1.0,32.0
turkey could also help alleviate labour shortage in old europe once its population comes of age,0.0,16.0
by 2014 one in four turks or about 18 million people will be aged 14 or less,0.0,17.0
literate and qualified turkish population insisted mr sener will make positive impact on the eu,0.0,15.0
this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers wallets,0.0,19.0
however turkey assertions are confirmed by brussels own impact studies which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy,1.0,24.0
costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey membership with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and according to some predictions balloon to 33.5bn euros,1.0,30.0
this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid though such payments should decline as the country farm sector which currently employs one in three turks would employ just one in five by 2020,0.0,34.0
such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey government would never be delivered say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned,1.0,31.0

critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey economic roadmap has been over-egged an argument amplified by 134 rise in the country current account deficit to 10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year,1.0,36.0
the country massive debt which includes 23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets also remains major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu,1.0,30.0
in the new member states of the european union gross public debt is typically about 40 of gross domestic product says reza moghadam assistant director of the imf european department,1.0,30.0
at about 80 of gdp turkey gross debt is double that figure,1.0,12.0
turkey debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after run on the banks in 2001 caused the country devastating recession,1.0,25.0
there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past it remains quite vulnerable says michael deppler director of the imf european department,0.0,28.0
its debt is far too high for an emerging economy,0.0,10.0
key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria,1.0,17.0

the sale came despite restraining order issued by us court dealing with the firm bankruptcy application for chapter 11 protection,0.0,20.0
yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but russian authorities argued they were imposing the law trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes,1.0,25.0

think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues,0.0,20.0
also they should do more to help independent record labels have louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels,0.0,21.0
rather than expecting the government i.e,1.0,6.0
the taxpayer to fork out why don some of the megastars put something back in,0.0,15.0
some of britain wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc,0.0,16.0
there are far more important demands on government funds,0.0,9.0
if they can fund football why not fund music,1.0,9.0
areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music,1.0,15.0
we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music,1.0,29.0
the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash,0.0,12.0
the government has enough problems funding schools and health services,1.0,10.0
if alex kapranos genuinely thinks multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that,1.0,28.0
as scot living in england appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being success so can see no problem with it,0.0,22.0
franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods,0.0,35.0
think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such sorry state,1.0,26.0
the answer is most definitely no,0.0,6.0
those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn be looking for government subsidies,0.0,21.0
know that if was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping would want to finance myself until was in position to pursue corporate sponsorship,0.0,29.0
yes the government should fund music it brings joy to the masses,1.0,12.0
there are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal,0.0,18.0
getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use,1.0,17.0
as long as the government was funding real talent it would be great move,1.0,14.0
would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about,1.0,24.0
only if the proposals make financial sense,0.0,7.0
franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales if they had government grant to get started they have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out,0.0,42.0
however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they re musician,1.0,22.0
the government shouldn fund music it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment,1.0,20.0
think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise,0.0,17.0
the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people,0.0,15.0
however do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there,0.0,26.0
do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also responsibility held by record companies,1.0,19.0
they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for,0.0,32.0
if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn have to fork out great deal,1.0,23.0
music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands artists and stuff,1.0,17.0
pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities,1.0,16.0
agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer,1.0,26.0
there is great deal of money generated through pop music perhaps tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy,1.0,30.0
perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers,1.0,36.0
call it tax on music pollution if you like,1.0,9.0
though really like franz ferdinand have to disagree with mr kapranos,0.0,11.0
once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues,0.0,21.0
many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting,1.0,27.0
the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations like save the music in the us,1.0,17.0

there must be more than dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more,1.0,17.0
presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low,0.0,14.0
actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years,1.0,19.0

angels is awful piece of sentimental claptrap,0.0,7.0
it musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated bit like mr williams himself,0.0,13.0
this result isn very surprising though the brits has long history of celebrating rubbish music,0.0,15.0
best of the last 25 years,1.0,6.0
cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it bit of hollow award really,0.0,25.0
not much competition in the last 25 years after all,0.0,10.0
it alright for pop song but the best song of the last 25 years,1.0,14.0
there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years it travesty,1.0,21.0
who voted it for it to be included in any list,0.0,11.0
am regular listener to radio but don recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn know good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years,1.0,50.0
how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out where on earth did this dreadful list appear from,0.0,23.0
while am biassed in that thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty,1.0,46.0
then again well done robbie good show,1.0,7.0
you ve got to be kidding,0.0,6.0
angels is great song but not the best song of the last 25 years,1.0,14.0
only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits,1.0,12.0
think angels is great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but don think its the best song from the past 25 years,1.0,28.0
right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song isn that good,1.0,35.0
best song in the last 25 years,1.0,7.0
think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels,1.0,23.0
phil collins doesn deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote,1.0,12.0
angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it,1.0,16.0
hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards,0.0,20.0
so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me it proof that music and democracy just don mix,0.0,26.0
still at least it wasn will young,0.0,7.0
oh it all just bit of fun,0.0,7.0
people take these awards too seriously,0.0,6.0
robbie has millions of loyal fans while even non-fans know the words to angels,1.0,14.0
him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards,0.0,9.0
personally wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent,0.0,16.0
hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with,0.0,17.0
never get fed up hearing it,0.0,6.0
whenever the song comes on the radio turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out,1.0,32.0
the song makes me calm and serene and happy,1.0,9.0
think that although robbie williams is good performer that angels isn really that good song,1.0,15.0
it certainly isn anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush,0.0,22.0
all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers,0.0,8.0
it song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups,1.0,12.0
robbie did in no way deserve that mantle,0.0,8.0
whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example,1.0,34.0
they weren cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think,1.0,23.0
yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years because it touches the soul as it carries lot of meaning,1.0,22.0
believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting,0.0,27.0
it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don particularly like music all that much,1.0,20.0
folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music,0.0,21.0
angels adds nothing it is merely an irritating distraction wasp that refuses to go away on summer afternoon picnic,0.0,19.0
if you voted for it you should feel ashamed of yourself you probably only know dozen songs or so don you so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote,1.0,35.0
last five years might be willing to accept but 25 no way,0.0,12.0
did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say 1995,0.0,14.0
really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of century,0.0,14.0
no surprise about robbie williams considering the list,0.0,8.0
where on earth did the nominations list come from,0.0,9.0
compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps,0.0,7.0
what load of crap best song in the last 25 years don think so,1.0,14.0
what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years the list is endless but robbie williams doesn even come close,1.0,24.0
that song has become such bane to me that have developed pavlovian response to the word angels where thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radio off,1.0,34.0
why half-baked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past 25 years is beyond me,1.0,45.0
if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up,1.0,18.0
why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country,0.0,10.0
the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last 25 years,1.0,17.0
think not didn realize radio had so many listeners under the age of 10,0.0,14.0
great song yes but the best of the last 25 years,1.0,11.0
think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here,1.0,13.0
the great british public at work again,0.0,7.0
it mediocre sentimental and safe song,1.0,6.0
granted it not too bad either,0.0,6.0
but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now,0.0,16.0
or anything from the stone roses first album,0.0,8.0
no because not female and not 10,0.0,7.0
ok like robbie and angels is decent song,1.0,8.0
but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years,1.0,13.0
the shortlist wasn great but him winning it is joke,0.0,10.0
the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years,1.0,21.0
the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed,0.0,25.0
whilst angels is popular song it is not even the best song in robbie repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years,1.0,24.0
am huge robbie fan and love that song,1.0,8.0
but think there are lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list,1.0,23.0
have radio listeners even heard of joy division,0.0,8.0
band who through two albums have had bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will,1.0,26.0
there not song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling,1.0,11.0
some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with far larger audience than any other song,1.0,21.0
it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song,1.0,24.0
sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today,0.0,38.0
think its brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people,1.0,11.0
there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win,1.0,13.0
am astounded that such second-rate record has beaten such line up of amazing songs,0.0,14.0
it terrible song voted for by the masses who don have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music,1.0,19.0
the best song of the past 25 years,1.0,8.0
come on this is surely joke,0.0,6.0
it just goes to show that the british public do not have clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division,1.0,31.0
suppose it confirmed one thing the british public are consistently dull lt,0.0,12.0
there must be thousand better songs than formulated cheesy pop song for kids,1.0,13.0
no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and further nail in the coffin,0.0,24.0
think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide,0.0,28.0
anybody who says he doesn deserve it is jealous of his success,0.0,12.0
the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust,0.0,13.0
obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it,0.0,11.0
if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble,1.0,19.0
sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record,1.0,15.0
it not the type of music normally like but even as diehard rock fan recognise that it is good song and appelas to most people,1.0,25.0
that why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years,1.0,13.0
it nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes,0.0,10.0
but this is not great music,0.0,6.0
suppose it just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become,0.0,13.0
granted angels is good song however it really wasn up against any other proper competition,1.0,15.0
the queen song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic,1.0,15.0
also why weren the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angels wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn getting more awards so they had to make one up for him,1.0,39.0
best song of the last 25 years,1.0,7.0
what ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner,0.0,9.0
on the upside at least it wasn bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful,0.0,16.0
angels is without doubt great song but really don think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song,1.0,36.0
don get me wrong not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners,0.0,14.0
it would have been travesty had angels not won,0.0,9.0
without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists,0.0,28.0
"it has to be seen performed live with 125,000 people singing along to be fully appreciated",0.0,16.0
find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past 25 years,1.0,19.0
rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning,1.0,24.0
blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different,0.0,16.0
why must best always come down to most commercially popular,1.0,10.0
ve nothing against robbie actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year,1.0,21.0
the brits has proved to be nothing more than bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales,0.0,22.0
the same goes with the scissor sisters think this is superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near u2 new record neither are they in the same league,0.0,35.0
once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit,0.0,18.0
no surprise really it voted for by the general public,0.0,10.0
since when did they have taste in music,0.0,8.0
personally find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs have ever heard,1.0,17.0
it is song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come,1.0,19.0
it an absolute joke however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well,0.0,16.0
all in all pretty pointless exercise,0.0,6.0
the song is overplayed and oversentimental,1.0,6.0
out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen,0.0,20.0
suppose we should be thankful that it didn end up in the hands of will young though,0.0,17.0
although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win,0.0,13.0
everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares etc,0.0,10.0
much better songs and more timeless,1.0,6.0
give it to someone with real talent,0.0,7.0
although angels is good song think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years,1.0,27.0
this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye,0.0,17.0
why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that all it means,0.0,17.0

don feel like urban music just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that there an urban music scene because it all kick in the teeth at the end of the day,1.0,40.0
if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she signed to then so be it,0.0,31.0
it got nothing to do with what really going on,0.0,10.0
urban as genre is very broad,1.0,6.0
if you look underneath urban there are number of core elements that include hip-hop garage and into that obviously comes soul,0.0,21.0
her first album was called the soul sessions,0.0,8.0
so urban is very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub-genres and there are offshoots of all of those,0.0,23.0
joss stone has had amazing success in the us given that she uk artist,0.0,14.0
what has really captured everybody imagination is that here you have 17-year-old from devon with voice to die for and bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good think that what done it,0.0,35.0
the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base,0.0,15.0
don think joss was not worthy winner,0.0,7.0
she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban,1.0,17.0
the fact that she from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she literally rural,0.0,26.0
the great thing about urban music is that there big range,1.0,11.0
if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain think that where you can call it urban that where this new sub-category or uber-category has come from,1.0,33.0
joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldn argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions it is coming from somewhere genuine,0.0,37.0
it has to come across as real,0.0,7.0
that the only cut-off point we have here and that the only way by which we judge people,0.0,18.0
what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from black background,1.0,21.0
music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for multi-cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion,0.0,22.0
if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too,1.0,25.0
race doesn make difference if everyone is included,0.0,8.0
out of all the awards dished out yesterday still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award,0.0,25.0
type of music especially street music that originates from city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life,1.0,19.0
she might not be urban but when did become the hip hop tainted thing it is now,0.0,17.0
stands for rhythm and blues remember,0.0,6.0
that joss stone is rubbish is certain,0.0,7.0
if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music think probably should include hip-hop soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes good claim,1.0,35.0
she definitely deserved to win prize joss stone albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year,1.0,23.0
this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren nominated or didn win,1.0,25.0
cant see why people can just congratulate her for the talent that she is,0.0,14.0
she did deserve it but agree with the comments about urban music,1.0,12.0
its stupid phrase and particularly british,0.0,6.0
in the states they tend to use hip hop and if say hip hop here lot of people have no idea what talking about,0.0,24.0
rose by any other name etc,0.0,6.0
if people want to call it urban why not,1.0,9.0
if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesn describe everything you can dance to,0.0,20.0
whilst agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won,1.0,21.0
urban to me is what hear being played in parties in the inner cities live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of bass heavy sound system in any parties ve been to,0.0,38.0
good luck to joss stone let celebrate her victory let also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast we didn see single black artist on stage collecting an award,0.0,41.0
so what you re saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn black,1.0,24.0
and if it is then they shouldn be acknowledged for it even if they re pretty dam good at it,0.0,20.0
she 17 has an amazing voice and won,0.0,8.0
oh but she not black well let make her feel real bad about it then,0.0,15.0
though hang on didn the so-called public vote on this one,0.0,11.0
this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what jazz was,0.0,28.0
the media then called anything that had swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists,0.0,22.0
it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time,0.0,24.0
jazz was and remains such massively misunderstood term,0.0,8.0
and so what of urban music,1.0,6.0
in truth it lazy term to categorise music that you don really understand,1.0,13.0
soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye tuff jam,0.0,11.0
but no doubt have their connections,0.0,6.0
if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents,1.0,39.0
sucks to the cities- it way better out here,0.0,9.0
we have hay for one thing,0.0,6.0
excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely,1.0,27.0
dont understand the point that ty is making,0.0,8.0
if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing,1.0,18.0
how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside,0.0,16.0
love joss to bits and don care what her branding is it amazing music full stop,1.0,16.0
stop puting it all in brackets and let just call it music and let especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour,1.0,45.0
surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from,1.0,35.0
joss stone is simply singing certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music,1.0,33.0
if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style,0.0,28.0
the term urban in reference to music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards,1.0,24.0
the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people,1.0,13.0
this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards,1.0,12.0
it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable,1.0,17.0
the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind,1.0,26.0
the result is now redundant new debate as to what urban also means,0.0,13.0
perhaps we should have created new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul rnb and hip-hop one which does not also mean something else as we have done with crunk,0.0,32.0
urban is just word that come about recently to describe black music that become popular now,1.0,16.0
the word wasn even in use or common use five of six years ago,0.0,14.0
it just way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it,0.0,29.0
in band that has been called urban and despise the label,0.0,11.0
hate to think belonged to any neat marketing niche because that all it is,0.0,14.0
ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into commodity,1.0,32.0
look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music,1.0,30.0
ignore the labels it is what it is just music,1.0,10.0
as black man think agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives,0.0,19.0
black people should lead the music they invented,1.0,8.0
we should stop calling genre meaningless northing is meaningless,0.0,9.0
the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black,1.0,22.0
same thing with streets amy winehouse etc,0.0,7.0
who ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson,0.0,9.0
they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and think mobos but why not brits,1.0,25.0
so what if joss stone won the urban awards,1.0,9.0
her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner,1.0,13.0
what if the streets had won,0.0,6.0
would people be whining because mike skinner is white,0.0,9.0
it seems that lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else,0.0,20.0
urban is pc version for saying black music,1.0,8.0
not doubting ms stone talent but why didn jamelia or lemar get brit,0.0,13.0
this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up brit seems to be the hardest thing,0.0,32.0
refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days,0.0,13.0
you have said it there is music you like and music you don like who cares what label you put on it,1.0,22.0
how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone,0.0,12.0
its like putting eminem against bob geldof,0.0,7.0
she should have been nominated for best british act,0.0,9.0
joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but don think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams,1.0,25.0
urban is nonsense term music of black origin,1.0,8.0
music made in the inner cities,1.0,6.0
well almost all bands end up making music in london manchester etc,0.0,12.0
and doesn that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities,0.0,14.0
why does music have to be put into genre,1.0,9.0
it music you like it or you don,1.0,8.0
we are urban music as far as concerned,1.0,8.0
we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musically,0.0,21.0
urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music,1.0,13.0
why it needed rebrand don know as the name is misleading,0.0,11.0
oasis originate from city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as they re white rock band they won be described as such,0.0,31.0
joss stone has fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the brit,0.0,21.0
all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored,1.0,19.0
urban is crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though,0.0,13.0
there only two kinds of music good and bad,1.0,9.0

"we will definitely extend the maternity pay from the six months where it now is to nine months that the extra 1,400",1.0,22.0

mr beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the e-mail regime could support the freedom of information regime,1.0,20.0
mr thomas said the new act of parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes criminal offence,1.0,25.0

mothers can currently take up to six months paid leave and six unpaid,0.0,13.0

career sexism is about saying that engineering for instance where only 10 of employees are women is really male-dominated industry,1.0,20.0

however he added that perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage,0.0,14.0

but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence,0.0,15.0
understand why but think there is much bigger message here that has been obscured,0.0,14.0
mr law from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland believed damage had been done to scotland fight against binge drinking,0.0,19.0

we don want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically,0.0,18.0
this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is culture about binge drinking and drunkenness,0.0,29.0
he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk,1.0,23.0

former civil service chief lord butler has criticised the way tony blair government operates accusing it of being obsessed with headlines,0.0,21.0
he also attacked the way the iraq war was sold to the public with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out,0.0,24.0
tory leader michael howard said lord butler had given the most damaging testimony he could remember,1.0,16.0
but downing street said mr blair should be judged by results not his style,0.0,14.0
lord butler said mr blair bypassed the cabinet and relied instead on small informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions,1.0,22.0
the prime minister official spokesman said the cabinet was still used to achieve consensus on important issues,0.0,17.0
but he added you can not in modern government take every decision in cabinet,0.0,14.0
lord butler said the government had too much freedom to bring in bad bills and to do whatever it likes and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees,1.0,31.0
the former cabinet secretary said in an interview with the spectator magazine would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling there is too much central control and there is too little of what would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments,0.0,52.0
mr howard described lord butler intervention as very important,1.0,9.0
this is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the blair government,1.0,16.0
it is certainly the most damaging testimony can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position,0.0,17.0
lord butler report earlier this year into iraq intelligence said the government september 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was very thin,1.0,36.0
the reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers case for war lord butler said in his spectator interview which was conducted by the magazine editor conservative mp boris johnson,1.0,32.0
he said when civil servants give material to ministers they say these are the conclusions we ve drawn but we ve got to tell you the evidence we ve got is pretty thin,0.0,33.0
similarly if you are giving something to the united nations and the country you should warn them,0.0,17.0
asked why he thought the warnings were not there lord butler said one has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was,1.0,24.0
the purpose of the dossier was to persuade the british why the government thought iraq was very serious threat,1.0,19.0
when asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole he replied well,0.0,15.0
think we are country where we suffer very badly from parliament not having sufficient control over the executive and that is very grave flaw,0.0,24.0
we should be breaking away from the party whip,0.0,9.0
the executive is much too free to bring in huge number of extremely bad bills huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow,0.0,37.0
all that is part of what is bad government in this country,0.0,12.0
lord butler assessment was backed by his predecessor as cabinet secretary lord armstrong,1.0,13.0
lord armstrong told bbc two newsnight agree there doesn appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect,0.0,33.0
liberal democrat deputy leader menzies campbell said he thought lord butler comments were well justified and mr blair style of leadership was corrosive of the whole system of government,1.0,29.0

lib dem spokesman mark oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying,1.0,17.0
he told bbc news extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened,0.0,25.0
that must be bad for government it must be bad for public confidence in the system,0.0,16.0
mr oaten said people would be mystified why sir alan inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up,1.0,23.0
he said there is strong case for judge-led judicial review of this because of course next time it happens it may not be about nanny and their visa,1.0,28.0
it may be about something even more important than that,0.0,10.0
so we do need to understand what took place and who was involved,0.0,13.0
the tories criticised the lib dem stance saying mr oaten had initially said he accepted mr blunkett word unless further evidence emerged,1.0,22.0
but lib dem officials say mr oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement,1.0,21.0

rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland,1.0,19.0

the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas,0.0,11.0
universities scotland which represents university principals claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out,1.0,21.0
director david caldwell said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities but this was not major factor,1.0,29.0
he told bbc radio scotland good morning scotland programme the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as very attractive place to study,0.0,43.0
they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated,1.0,43.0
however it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here,0.0,17.0
mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context,0.0,14.0
he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances the number was not huge an additional figure of about 200,0.0,20.0
also the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales where there are no plans for top-up fees have also risen by 19,0.0,26.0
mr wallace said accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held not just in britain,1.0,27.0
we want to make sure that when students are making their choice they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland,0.0,36.0
we do not want to have situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option,0.0,28.0

anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty committee of mps has warned,1.0,20.0
sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended the environment select committee said,1.0,24.0
the mps said they were concerned the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare,1.0,19.0
they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved mps said,0.0,13.0
they called for cast-iron guarantee that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing,0.0,23.0
the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation and intends to protect kept animals and companion animals by setting up duty of care,1.0,26.0
in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible,0.0,26.0
the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing mutilation of animals unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal best interest,1.0,34.0
the environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals,0.0,15.0
one was call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged even if they were to later fail,0.0,26.0
we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government intention to exempt fishing as an activity,0.0,33.0
but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought,0.0,14.0
however in exempting fishing the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given carte blanche to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity the committee added,0.0,36.0
the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill such as the law on abandonment of animals which would be significantly weakened,1.0,27.0
mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences,0.0,14.0
this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect or unnecessary mental suffering to go unpunished,1.0,34.0
committee chairman michael jack said any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest,1.0,22.0
this draft bill is no exception,0.0,6.0
my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn just wait for problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place,1.0,33.0
but mr jack said the bill very much had the feel of work in progress and urged the government to guarantee that an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs circuses and game bird farms,0.0,47.0
the government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to parliament he added,0.0,23.0

divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system mps have said,1.0,17.0
the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access,1.0,21.0
courts should be used as last resort but where they are their orders should be enforced more rigorously mps said,1.0,20.0
but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be legal presumption of equal access,0.0,19.0
currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount,0.0,12.0
an arbitrary template imposed on all families whatever the needs of the child would relegate the welfare of individual children to secondary position the mps said,1.0,26.0
they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases,1.0,32.0
this would reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety they said,1.0,38.0
delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed new status quo arrangement for the children to become established by default they said,1.0,27.0
although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present,0.0,28.0
given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents,0.0,33.0

at the moment far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation he said,0.0,30.0

the ministry of defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects,1.0,20.0
national audit office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by 1.7bn in the past year,1.0,19.0
it says there is little evidence the mod performance had improved despite the introduction of smart acquisition policy six years ago,0.0,21.0
senior defence official told the bbc lessons were being learned,0.0,10.0
the nao annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach 50bn 14 higher than originally planned,1.0,23.0
the total delays amounted to 62 months with average individual delays rising by three months,0.0,15.0
sir john bourn head of the nao said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied,0.0,25.0
many problems can be traced to the fact that the mod has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase the report says,0.0,25.0
the nao found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older legacy projects such as the eurofighter,0.0,27.0
senior defence official speaking to the bbc defence correspondent paul adams said that although the figures were still not good enough the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle,1.0,32.0
this year overspend was significantly less than last year 3.1bn total and the defence procurement agency which is responsible for buying defence equipment was improving,1.0,25.0
lord bach minister for defence procurement said he was obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown but insisted that the defence procurement agency had undertaken huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects,1.0,39.0
the latest findings follow string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months and according to our correspondent contain few new surprises,0.0,23.0
turning around the defence procurement agency was little like trying to turn around super tanker it takes very long time indeed he said,0.0,23.0
our correspondent said it was the same projects including the joint strike fighter the nimrod and a400m aircraft and the type 45 destroyer which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay,1.0,35.0

the trial scheme which could start in weeks may be extended to apply to children from other countries,0.0,18.0
children charities have reacted with alarm saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected,0.0,22.0
but the home office says it may be in the children best interests if it reunites them with their communities,0.0,20.0
the pilot included in the government five-year immigration plan aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims,1.0,24.0
"since 2002 at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members",0.0,18.0

up to now ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18,0.0,22.0
at least dozen albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return according to sources although there is no public confirmation of numbers,0.0,24.0

if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on case by case basis she said,0.0,22.0
we do not think there are structures in place to receive returning children in albania,0.0,15.0
if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child then that is forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision,1.0,29.0
in its five-year immigration plan announced on tuesday the government said it was addressing the difficult issue of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children,0.0,23.0
spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children and leave them to rot,1.0,24.0
we are developing returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused said the spokesman,1.0,21.0
we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it possible to return children in way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable,1.0,38.0
we do not believe that it is right or in keeping with children legislation that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities,1.0,31.0
the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations,0.0,13.0
only those children who could be provided with carefully planned reintegration package would be returned he said,1.0,17.0
but andrew hogg spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies,0.0,24.0
from what is so far known we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account said mr hogg,1.0,30.0
in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure,1.0,12.0
the medical foundation has many serious concerns including the assessment process for suitability for return the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries,1.0,37.0

those are some of the mistakes found under the current system where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants,0.0,25.0
the electoral commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud,1.0,16.0
voters need to register by 11 march if the next poll is on may as expected,0.0,16.0
but any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in britain before that general election,0.0,15.0
the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual identifiers when they vote such as their own voting number date of birth and signature,1.0,23.0
the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws,1.0,24.0
chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process which happened when northern ireland switched to similar system,1.0,32.0
there have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll the mps heard,0.0,18.0
and some people have registered all their family regardless of their age birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers can not easily check,0.0,27.0
non-british citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases,0.0,15.0
mr younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes,1.0,22.0
he argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at hard to reach voters for example,0.0,18.0
some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out,0.0,23.0
"mr younger said using the royal mail postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters",1.0,19.0
he argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting,0.0,17.0
there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form,1.0,23.0
he said it might also help register students in halls of residences where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody,0.0,24.0
the mps on the office of the deputy prime minister and constitutional affairs select committees pressed mr younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover,0.0,27.0

in speech in london on monday mr howard said it not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it,1.0,25.0
he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that firm but fair immigration controls were essential for good community relations,0.0,23.0

we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum mr howard said,1.0,16.0

and spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case,1.0,32.0

labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising,1.0,22.0
but that did not happen for voter identification calls,0.0,9.0
when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said,1.0,26.0
so it is not covered by the telephone preference service,0.0,10.0
he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again,1.0,26.0
conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers,1.0,14.0
she said we do apply tps but in line with the law,1.0,12.0
we would not do things that are not allowed in the law,0.0,12.0
spokesman for the information commissioner office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them,1.0,25.0
but the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of bigger set of statistics not person by person,0.0,30.0
if political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing he said,1.0,18.0
the spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if party recorded voting preferences with view to marketing information in the future,1.0,22.0
the spokesman said there was no yes or no answer and the area was pretty grey,0.0,16.0

hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner,0.0,18.0
mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them,1.0,41.0

in speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of george bush mr kennedy said iraq had become crucible of militant terrorism,1.0,22.0
he wants to see phased withdrawal of uk troops as soon as the situation allows he said in london,0.0,19.0
any exit strategy must augment and support the democratic process,0.0,10.0
there are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of british and american troops in iraq feeds the insurgency he said,0.0,24.0
there is some truth in that especially after the initial mistakes that were made the heavy-handedness of operations like fallujah and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces,0.0,32.0
mr kennedy pointed out that the netherlands portugal and the czech republic which all have troops operating in the southern sector of iraq have announced their imminent withdrawal regardless of the situation on the ground,1.0,35.0

the first minister comments came in question and answer session at glenurquhart high school in inverness attended by pupils from number of secondary schools,0.0,24.0
highland councillor who was at the event has also defended mr mcconnell,0.0,12.0
margaret davidson the independent member for the loch ness west said the first minister was speaking in very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time,0.0,32.0
when one pupil asked mr mcconnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking began his response with the quip sure there no under-age drinking in the highlands,0.0,28.0
he went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions,0.0,17.0
he said hope not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people health and their ability to control what happening round about them,0.0,42.0
mr mcconnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes and on the health consequences of binge drinking,1.0,29.0
the one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that he said,1.0,27.0
far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly,0.0,25.0
we are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy drink sensibly over the course of an evening,0.0,28.0
he added by all means get drunk once in while but do not get into situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly,0.0,34.0
snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said this is an incredible gaffe by jack mcconnell,0.0,14.0
we all know that under-age drinking is an issue in scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician particularly the first minister should encourage young people to get drunk,1.0,30.0
the first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately,0.0,8.0
but an executive spokeswoman insisted mr mcconnell had made the remark with adults not youngsters in mind,0.0,17.0
he was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions which are for the over-18s she said,1.0,21.0

brown hits back in blair rift row,0.0,7.0
gordon brown has criticised union leader who said conflict between himself and tony blair was harming the workings of government,0.0,20.0
jonathan baume of the top civil servants union spoke of competing agendas between mr brown and mr blair,1.0,18.0
but the chancellor said mr baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge,1.0,20.0
he said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members jobs,0.0,17.0
it suited the purpose of mr baume union the first division association to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms mr brown told bbc radio today programme,0.0,39.0
"under the plans unveiled in the gershon report some 84,000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services",0.0,26.0
mr brown said to be honest don think you can rely on his mr baume judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making,1.0,30.0
mr blair and are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms,1.0,13.0
we are determined to go on with the gershon reforms,0.0,10.0
he also said that as mr baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister he was not in position to judge,1.0,25.0
on wednesday ahead of the chancellor pre-budget report mr baume told bbc news there were sometimes conflicting and competing agendas for government between number 10 and the treasury,0.0,28.0
what the chancellor wanted was not by any means what alan milburn and the prime minister want to see mr baume said,1.0,22.0
government departments get their money from the treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that not necessarily the same as the treasury and the prime minister is of course very powerful figure in any government,0.0,53.0
he also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement policy agenda,0.0,26.0
the problem is that on many occasions these two don add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle,0.0,27.0
number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not soap opera about mr blair and mr brown,1.0,18.0
tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin said the battle royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and tony blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money,0.0,40.0
tories would cut number of mps,0.0,6.0
the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one-fifth if they were elected tory leader michael howard has said,1.0,22.0
the plan forms part of the party smaller government bill to be unveiled later this week,0.0,16.0
mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers,1.0,17.0
and he said referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly,1.0,19.0
the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning general election mr howard told the paper,0.0,20.0
the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum but it would probably mean reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659,0.0,31.0
if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps,0.0,14.0
"mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall labour by more than 80,000 and the tories by almost 100,000 they should accept similar drop in their own numbers",1.0,36.0
it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced but what about ministers parliament and special advisers,0.0,19.0
shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people lives by reducing the size and role of the state,0.0,33.0
mr howard said the plan would also even out the great unfairness of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england,1.0,27.0
"the average size of an english constituency was 70,000 people mr howard said",1.0,13.0
"in northern ireland it was just over 66,000 in wales just over 59,000 and in scotland 53,000",0.0,17.0
the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom if the assembly was scrapped,0.0,32.0
mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next,1.0,20.0

home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached,1.0,16.0
the move follows law lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at belmarsh prison london and woodhill milton keynes was unlawful,0.0,22.0
the 12 affected by the ruling are from algeria tunisia egypt and jordan,0.0,13.0
the government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws,0.0,24.0
mr clarke told the times think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come,1.0,27.0
he said it was route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw in very positive way,0.0,20.0
mr clarke said that he was seeking memorandums of understanding between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return,1.0,29.0
however he added do not think the solution to the law lords judgement for this government is in deportations but they will help,0.0,23.0
there are other strands that we have to do,0.0,9.0
but the liberal democrat shadow home secretary mark oaten accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees,1.0,21.0
the critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future he told bbc news,0.0,34.0
and do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing for example intercept communications telephone tapping to be included mr oaten said,0.0,35.0
deportation may tackle this initial problem but want to see wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country,0.0,25.0
unless we get that the liberal democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in march,0.0,19.0
the bbc home affairs correspondent daniel sandford said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor david blunkett,1.0,26.0
but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees home countries could be difficult,1.0,16.0
some of these people are accused of very very serious crimes in their home countries so it not an easy agreement to get and think for some of these suspects it won be the solution,1.0,35.0
daniel sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing more secret trials process in the next few weeks,0.0,35.0
the government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial he said,1.0,30.0

deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research,0.0,11.0
snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure,0.0,16.0
the rise in costs stems from series of mistakes in the research used by the care development group of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university fraser of allander institute,1.0,43.0
dubious assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another 130m by 2022 the report warned,0.0,22.0
it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert,0.0,14.0
but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland we don think we got our sums wrong,0.0,15.0
obviously we will examine the findings of this new report along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned,0.0,22.0
we will look in great detail at any contribution to this because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future,1.0,33.0
and we are absolutely committed to doing that,0.0,8.0
but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy,1.0,24.0
ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive support for the policy there were questions which needed to be answered and if necessary sums redone,1.0,30.0
she said serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive,0.0,20.0
we need to know that the money is there not just for this year or next year but into the future so that older people and those who are looking forward to older age can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met,0.0,45.0

local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters such as the transport referendum,1.0,21.0
therefore residents who have exercised their right to have their details left off the list could miss the chance to vote,1.0,21.0
however there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of february voting deadline,0.0,30.0
mr ballard said this vote will set the future of transport in edinburgh for decades to come,0.0,17.0
it is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in edinburgh city and the surrounding areas are registered to vote in the ballot,1.0,24.0

new drink limit would cut toll,0.0,6.0
more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by third report says,0.0,16.0
university college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives year,1.0,23.0
the findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government road safety bill,0.0,25.0
the bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit,1.0,13.0
the research carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk roads compared with 2003,1.0,29.0
he estimates that this would save the country 119m year,0.0,10.0
previous estimate contained in 1998 department of transport document suggested such move could save 50 lives year,0.0,17.0
the findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking,1.0,41.0
professor allsop said reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver bac blood alcohol content is within 30mg of the current limit,1.0,42.0
only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times,0.0,28.0

liberal democrat transport spokesman john thurso said drink-driving remained major killer with figures showing worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking,0.0,27.0
he said there had been 29 drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997 which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving,0.0,34.0
the road safety bill which gets its second reading on tuesday would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court currently blood test is needed,0.0,29.0
it also includes plans for staggered speeding fines and points system penalising drivers who exceed limits by wide margin more than those who are caught going just over,1.0,28.0
these have been criticised by road safety campaigners including labour backbencher gwyneth dunwoody who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas leading to more road casualties,1.0,35.0

"the executive faces more than 1,000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates",1.0,15.0
more than 310 actions have already been raised in the court of session and sheriff courts in scotland,0.0,18.0

he was awarded compensation last april after winning his case,0.0,10.0
executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging breach of the european convention on human rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should be beyond reasonable doubt,1.0,35.0
this is the standard normally applied in criminal trials in scotland,0.0,11.0
however civil litigation is settled on the test of balance of probabilities,0.0,12.0
judge lord cullen sitting with lord osborne and lord hamilton ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard,0.0,28.0

police are still searching for ferguson who failed to return after trip to east kilbride on monday,0.0,17.0

she said the scottish executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of mr ferguson was matter for carstairs,1.0,19.0
however my understanding is that under the mental health legislation the decision to grant this patient and any restricted patient leave of absence would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers,0.0,33.0

he said we understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for michael ferguson to be released unescorted from carstairs,1.0,27.0
the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers they have legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it,1.0,41.0
but at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised,0.0,32.0
scottish conservative leader david mcletchie said earlier it was almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen,1.0,19.0
the executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by psychiatric advisor in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers,1.0,21.0
she said ministers were told of that notified of it but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off,1.0,23.0

ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers amid continuing rows concerning string of unauthorised encampments,0.0,18.0
councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land,0.0,19.0
more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks said housing minister yvette cooper,1.0,18.0
"in november mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3,500 travellers have no place to stop",1.0,18.0
ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places,1.0,23.0
that scheme has paid out 25m in four years with 8m available for 2005,0.0,14.0
there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites said ms cooper,1.0,20.0
firstly local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites,0.0,15.0
and secondly they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites,0.0,16.0
the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers,0.0,26.0
that is why we are consulting on new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and can not be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment,0.0,52.0
under the new regulations expected to be in force in the spring officials will be able to serve temporary stop notices aimed at preventing works on site before council has had chance to obtain full legal ban,1.0,37.0
many mps with rural constituencies particularly in eastern england have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments,0.0,32.0
andrew ryder of the traveller law reform coalition said we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers so long as it is real obligation as opposed to recommendation which could be and was easily ignored,1.0,42.0

in their november report mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister responsible for housing said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by lack of places to stop,1.0,32.0
numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities said the mps,1.0,17.0
in turn the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents,0.0,19.0

that comment referred to the setting up of scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry,0.0,17.0
he also said defra had been dreadfully slow in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis,1.0,21.0
the outbreak which began in 2001 led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals devastated many farms and rural businesses and is estimated to have cost the uk up to 8bn,0.0,31.0
four years after the outbreak defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors costs and 40m of invoices remain unpaid mr leigh said,1.0,28.0
mr leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an it system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed,1.0,20.0
in november it emerged european commission compensation amounted to just over third of the money the uk government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis,0.0,34.0
ministers had hoped to get 900m from the european union vet fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted 349m,0.0,27.0
that was because the uk had valued the culled animals at between two and three times the commission assessment of their likely market value,0.0,24.0
national audit office chief sir john bourn said new compensation scheme was now being looked at,1.0,16.0
on the issue of the unpaid invoices sir john said defra had paid 97 of the 1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001 but has not agreed final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations,0.0,37.0

plans to create single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped,0.0,11.0
the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments,1.0,19.0
the national correctional agency would have provided one-stop justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition,0.0,20.0
instead scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending,1.0,17.0
the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending,1.0,32.0
scotland reoffending rate is high with more than 60 of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail,0.0,19.0
this is leading to an ever-expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem,0.0,16.0

however following consultation on the idea justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans,0.0,16.0
instead ms jamieson will change the law to help produce closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system,0.0,20.0
she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday aiming to break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community,1.0,29.0
the new measures will place new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships,0.0,21.0
national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the sps role and performance in reducing reoffending,0.0,23.0
the minister said better joint working will help prisons play much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there,1.0,48.0
communities who are paying the price for this reoffending both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs expect better,1.0,22.0
"it costs the taxpayer 35,000 year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing",1.0,16.0
taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison,0.0,17.0
therefore as we continue to invest in the service it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves to ministers and to parliament,0.0,34.0

there was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003 mps said,1.0,14.0
the report which followed year-long inquiry by the committee found the high death rate amounts to serious failure to protect the right to life of highly vulnerable group,1.0,28.0
many of those who ended up taking their own lives had presented themselves to the authorities with these problems before they even offended the report said,1.0,26.0
it questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided,0.0,26.0
increased resources and reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term the report said,0.0,22.0

rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were not proportionate and discriminatory,1.0,14.0

we re currently taking legal opinion on this,0.0,8.0
we ll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we ll be looking at taking case on this to the human rights court ms beynon said,1.0,30.0
the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights,1.0,17.0
in report published last july the cross-party committee stated there was significant risk the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were disproportionate,1.0,30.0

they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases,0.0,9.0

mr rimmer the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north-west london said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties,1.0,30.0
it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry for example in holland germany or france,0.0,37.0

the government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court senior eu politician says,1.0,17.0
javier solana eu foreign policy chief says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other european countries,1.0,17.0

under the anti-terrorism crimes and security act 2001 foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge,0.0,21.0
several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court,1.0,21.0
some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts,0.0,10.0
human rights group liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard these detainees could be brought to trial,0.0,20.0
but critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services,1.0,20.0
the home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance,1.0,22.0
but mr clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after law lords ruled it illegal,0.0,20.0
he has opted for system of control orders whereby suspects both british and foreign can be held under house arrest or surveillance,0.0,22.0
these orders will again involve uk opt-out of parts of the european convention on human rights,0.0,16.0
while accepting that people have to be prepared for possible terrorist attack mr solana said he had qualms about the home secretary new plans,0.0,24.0

the all-party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting,1.0,16.0
they include proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years,0.0,17.0
lord condon head of the international cricket council anti-corruption unit who originally made the call for longer prison sentences said the two-year penalty was derisory,0.0,25.0
you could get bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports,0.0,21.0
symbolically higher penalty perhaps as the bill passes through the two houses might be appropriate,0.0,15.0
the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have say in the type of bets offered to punters and for bookmakers to set up audit trails something the new betting exchanges already do to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced,1.0,41.0
lord faulkner of worcester who chaired the inquiry said whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges because of the facility they provide to bet against result has increased the potential for corruption,1.0,52.0
it is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately,0.0,26.0
the panel aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right,0.0,29.0

authorities will decide final figures on thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation which is currently 1.6,0.0,23.0
the finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased,1.0,24.0
they say much additional government money is for new initiatives,0.0,10.0
scottish finance minister tom mccabe msp said last week in parliament announced an additional 419m for core expenditure to local government in scotland,0.0,23.0
that 5.5 increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6 so think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint,1.0,34.0
mr mccabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years,0.0,18.0
he told bbc radio scotland sunday live programme here in scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems,1.0,38.0
we think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services,0.0,20.0
the councils umbrella organisation cosla which provided bbc scotland with the indicative figures for next year warned that councils would face continuous struggle to maintain services,1.0,26.0
mr mccabe has promised them about 8.1bn next year,0.0,9.0
however most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services cosla spokesman said,1.0,22.0
cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services,0.0,25.0
they say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending,1.0,21.0
the conservatives accuse the scottish executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax,0.0,23.0
the tory finance spokesman brian monteith msp said its form of disguise yet again we see that council tax is being used as way of passing on costs,1.0,28.0
scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up what we ve seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill,1.0,42.0
there are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced,1.0,23.0
linda knox director of the scottish local authority management centre at strathclyde university said with this current settlement the increase is slowing,0.0,22.0
at the same time the burdens on councils are greater than they were,0.0,13.0
the settlement figures don include pay increases and the executive is also requiring substantial figure in the area of 325m in efficiency savings across the settlement period,0.0,27.0
education will be protected from any cuts but linda knox says this will mean other services will suffer,0.0,18.0
she said in practice that will mean 4-5 cut for other services,0.0,12.0
on the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.7 but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about in real terms,0.0,31.0

they are very much not for the good and will destroy scotland regiments by moulding them into single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems loss of local connections to those regiments and loss to scotland of an important part of her heritage and most importantly her future the regiments are the envy of armies around the world,1.0,60.0

teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas report says,1.0,22.0
the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000,1.0,17.0
but the percentage of poorer students hardly changed at all said its chief executive sir howard newby,0.0,17.0
increasingly more women than men went to university while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference,0.0,18.0
the hefce report drawing on child benefits data said teenagers in the richest areas could expect better than 50 chance of going to university while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10,1.0,32.0
participation at constituency level ranged from 69 in kensington and chelsea 65 in the city of london and westminster and 62 in sheffield hallam down to 10 in bristol south and leeds central and in nottingham north and sheffield brightside,0.0,40.0
sir howard said the report highlighted the entrenched divisions between rich and poor areas but added it was social as much as an educational problem,0.0,25.0
he told bbc news we know once children from deprived backgrounds get into university they do very well,0.0,18.0
in fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds,0.0,14.0
the issue is think one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people,0.0,25.0
he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils between the ages of 16 and 18 it was too late,1.0,21.0
instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier even down to primary school level to persuade them university education was something they could aspire to he said,1.0,31.0
but while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge there were some encouraging findings he added,0.0,21.0
tuition fees and student loans in england and wales and the different fee regime in scotland did not seem to have affected the choices of young people even the poorest,0.0,30.0

higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education,1.0,12.0
from 2006 upfront tuition fees in england would be removed with grants for the less well off,0.0,17.0
the shadow education secretary tim collins said it is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education,1.0,31.0
tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access,0.0,15.0
the group which represents university vice-chancellors universities uk said the new system of deferred fees in england due to start in 2006 with grants and bursaries for poorer students would encourage more of them to go into higher education,1.0,39.0
the national union of students argued the opposite that the situation was likely to get much worse with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration,0.0,37.0

here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll,0.0,21.0
we ve called for the state pension to be increased from 79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of 105.45,1.0,20.0
that what we re calling for,0.0,6.0
many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system,0.0,8.0
if we ve got one in five pensioners below the poverty line we ve got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty,1.0,27.0
we ve drawn up pensioners manifesto,0.0,6.0
this will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies,0.0,13.0
they will be asked which of the top five issues including the pension issue they would support,1.0,17.0
once we ve got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well,0.0,18.0
it our way of putting the politicians on notice,0.0,9.0
we are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters,1.0,36.0
before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative,0.0,6.0
in 1997 and 2001 they voted labour,0.0,7.0
but there is no guarantee they will vote for labour government this time around,1.0,14.0
they can not take that vote for granted,0.0,8.0

we don have any large demonstrations planned but they can be ruled out,0.0,13.0
it is hard to say whether we will be successful,1.0,10.0
we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq,1.0,41.0

people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad,1.0,12.0
the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting,1.0,10.0
it is another sort of form of shooting for sport,0.0,10.0

we will widely publicise what happening in relation to trophy hunting,0.0,11.0
we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk,1.0,13.0
we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would-be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports,1.0,25.0
we would like the support of political parties but think general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors,1.0,24.0
with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it,1.0,15.0
think what we will get is very real climbing up the agenda,1.0,12.0
whether or not we will get ban am not sure,1.0,10.0
but it will mobilise public opinion,0.0,6.0
everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to ban,1.0,15.0
the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice,1.0,14.0
the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum,1.0,14.0
choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade,0.0,13.0
it become an issue in itself but what really missing from the debate is the consumer choice in that,1.0,19.0
choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools,1.0,17.0
we have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there maximum of choice but minimum quality in that,1.0,22.0
we want choice on the consumer terms that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice,1.0,17.0
it features our campaigns and changes every day,0.0,8.0

the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians,0.0,16.0
it very much the language being used by the main political parties,0.0,12.0

if you re running 10 vehicles it obviously 10 times that,0.0,11.0
if fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified,0.0,10.0
there will be huge effect throughout the industry and would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations,0.0,18.0
what it will mean is there will be number of firms going out of business,0.0,15.0
we will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press,0.0,18.0
regrettably it one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press,1.0,17.0
whatever we do the public don like lorries they see us as complaining minority,1.0,14.0
but they don realise that when you see car on the road it is probably going to work when you see lorry it already at work,1.0,26.0
brown and blair face new rift claims,0.0,7.0
for the umpteenth time tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other,0.0,20.0
this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster an issue many hoped and believed was above such things,1.0,38.0
it dominated the prime minister monthly news conference which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour,1.0,33.0
as he told journalists am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers,0.0,15.0
there is complete unity of purpose,0.0,6.0
and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing great job and would continue doing it although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election,1.0,33.0
so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt he was asked,1.0,28.0
by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting,0.0,15.0
he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference,0.0,21.0
well not really as it happens,0.0,6.0
and he repeated what great man gordon was and how united they were before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world,1.0,48.0
although in the next breath he declared get increasingly alarmed by what read in the newspapers before catching himself on and quickly adding in so far as read them of course,0.0,31.0
he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men,0.0,25.0
as far as the timing of the prime minister press conference is concerned there are two options,1.0,17.0
the first is that it was calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment,1.0,24.0
if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling,0.0,23.0
the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements through the infamous downing street grid to avert just such allegations,0.0,35.0
either way the effect was the same to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on hugely pertinent issue,1.0,19.0
and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men,0.0,22.0
firstly the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries,0.0,31.0
it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt,1.0,35.0
then as if to pour fuel on the flames both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott without mentioning the other,0.0,45.0
all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from prominent role in general election planning and had as result started to set out his own platform,1.0,35.0
the prime minister denied all that as well repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign,1.0,30.0
but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that unless lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself,0.0,34.0
blair said he would stand down,0.0,6.0
tony blair promised gordon brown he would stand down before the next election new book about the chancellor claims,1.0,19.0
but the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the cabinet according to the book,1.0,18.0
the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other,1.0,19.0
the book brown britain said tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters trust,1.0,16.0
the author sources all unnamed allies of mr blair and mr brown said the prime minister felt the iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party,1.0,35.0
the book serialised in the sunday telegraph alleges that mr blair told the chancellor at dinner hosted by deputy pm john prescott in november 2003 of his intention to stand down,1.0,31.0
at that stage he saw gordon brown and said look you are the next most influential member of the government need your help to get through the next year mr peston said,1.0,32.0
myself recognise that going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and will then stand down,0.0,25.0
but he changed his mind in june 2004 following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him the book claims,1.0,29.0
mr peston told bbc news my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were,1.0,22.0
what the book says is there now pretty profound mutual mistrust mutual animosity,0.0,13.0
think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private don think the relationship is good because brown understandably feels deeply betrayed particularly over this issue of the leadership,0.0,34.0
there has been fresh speculation of rift recently following their separate responses to the asian tsunami,0.0,16.0
rumours of rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold mr blair monthly media conference at the same time as long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with new marshall plan for africa,0.0,39.0
there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other response to the disaster,0.0,15.0
former welfare minister frank field mp criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on gmtv sunday programme,0.0,17.0
what sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out,0.0,32.0
the labour mp for birkenhead asked,0.0,6.0
he said the prime minister should sack mr brown but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so,1.0,21.0
conservative policy co-ordinator david cameron mp for witney added if it wasn so serious it would be funny,0.0,18.0
but it is serious you ve got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime poverty or dirty hospitals they are fighting each other,0.0,29.0
carol walker bbc news 24 political correspondent added there is real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign,0.0,20.0
and clearly it is very bad news for the government at time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster,0.0,34.0
tony blair has dismissed reports he told gordon brown he would quit before the next general election,1.0,17.0
you don do deals over jobs like this the prime minister told bbc one breakfast with frost programme,0.0,18.0
according to new book brown britain mr blair went back on pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004,1.0,25.0
mr blair said the claims were reheated from six months ago and that he was concentrating on running the country,1.0,20.0
mr blair said ve dealt with this six months ago,1.0,10.0
said then you don do deals over jobs like this you don,0.0,12.0
what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country,0.0,15.0
the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston and serialised in the newspaper said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other,0.0,24.0
it claims tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters trust because of the iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party,0.0,30.0
and that at dinner hosted by deputy prime minister john prescott he told mr brown of his intention to stand down,1.0,21.0
according to mr peston the prime minister said help me to get through the year and will then stand down,1.0,20.0
but he then changed his mind in june 2004 following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him according to the book,0.0,31.0
mr peston told bbc news my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were,0.0,22.0

think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright but in private don think the relationship is good because brown understandably feels deeply betrayed particularly over this issue of the leadership,0.0,33.0
but in wide-ranging bbc interview covering issues such as the asian tsunami disaster the middle east peace process and northern ireland mr blair said when you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you,1.0,39.0
all sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims,0.0,11.0
he admitted to sense of frustration about the allegations which he said had been made countless times,0.0,17.0
there has been fresh speculation of rift recently following their separate responses to the asian tsunami,0.0,16.0
these rumours were fuelled by mr blair decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with new marshall plan for africa,0.0,37.0
there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other response to the disaster,0.0,15.0
but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as load of nonsense,1.0,20.0
former welfare minister frank field mp said the prime minister should sack mr brown but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so,1.0,26.0
tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of squabbling like schoolboys,1.0,15.0
he told sky news sunday with adam boulton this is the politics of the playground and britain really does deserve better,0.0,21.0
the liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was getting in the way of good government,1.0,25.0
either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they can not expect the electorate to support divided government at the next election,0.0,28.0
during the interview mr blair also said the former home secretary david blunkett would play big role at the general election,1.0,21.0
tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle,1.0,19.0
along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain,0.0,28.0
it is message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift,0.0,28.0
ian gibson for example urged the two men to stop squabbling declaring for goodness sake sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can,1.0,35.0
those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re-election,0.0,17.0
tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster behind-closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity,1.0,36.0
meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue,0.0,26.0
and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison,0.0,13.0
lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning,1.0,18.0
but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage,0.0,23.0
they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears,1.0,23.0
and it matters little whether the rift is real or as some try to suggest simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip,0.0,24.0
few in westminster actually believe that simply because the evidence appears to contradict it,1.0,14.0
for example the weekend attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick,1.0,18.0
even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments,0.0,31.0
mr blair talked about the new labour manifesto move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor who has long rejected the label,1.0,22.0
and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on deal to hand him the premiership last year,1.0,22.0
that claim was repeated in robert peston book book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act,0.0,24.0
for his part mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re-elected,1.0,14.0
the trouble is both men have fallen short of offering simple straightforward denials of the central claims,0.0,17.0
so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour,0.0,19.0
the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere,0.0,15.0
they started with and are sustained by friends of the two men,1.0,12.0
one only had to listen to the chancellor friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is real anger from this camp at the prime minister apparent attempts to confound mr brown leadership ambitions,0.0,39.0
but it is not just public pronouncements from ex-aides,0.0,9.0
there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides,0.0,10.0
it is no secret in westminster for example that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in mammoth sulk and acting in petty and deliberately provocative manner,0.0,27.0
then there are the actions of the men themselves,1.0,9.0
gordon brown sets out what is seen as rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign,1.0,19.0
the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with keynote speech by the chancellor,0.0,18.0
meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter which they believe is media-only obsession or that they fear for the efficient running of government beset by such rivalry,0.0,35.0
either way there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage,0.0,24.0
there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put lid on all the speculation,1.0,20.0
but with probably only four months to the next election that looks like being particularly difficult trick to pull off,0.0,20.0
brown in appeal for labour unity,0.0,6.0
gordon brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed mr blair went back on pledge to stand down before the next general election,1.0,25.0
the chancellor would not comment on the reports but insisted he would not be diverted or distracted from tackling the challenges faced by the country,0.0,25.0
his only motivation was to ensure labour was re-elected he insisted,0.0,11.0
mr blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on promise to stand aside for gordon brown as old news,1.0,20.0
according to new book brown britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston mr blair went back on pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004,1.0,31.0
in an interview with bbc one breakfast with frost mr blair said ve dealt with this six months ago,1.0,19.0
said then you don do deals over jobs like this you don,0.0,12.0
what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country,0.0,15.0
in separate interview with bbc political editor andrew marr mr brown said it very important that we all do what we can in unified way to ensure the election of labour government,1.0,32.0
think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that have,0.0,14.0
that is my purpose in politics and that is what every day seek to do,0.0,15.0
and am not going to be diverted or distracted nor is tony blair by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip,0.0,22.0
the only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country,0.0,26.0
mr brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do,1.0,30.0
but mr peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other and that mr blair had decided in november 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters trust because of the iraq war,1.0,39.0
he then changed his mind in june 2004 following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him according to the book,0.0,30.0
andrew marr said this is enormously damaging,0.0,7.0
gordon brown knows it as well as tony blair,1.0,9.0
think the relationship is genuinely privately very poor indeed,0.0,9.0
he added lots of ministers believe tony blair will attempt to move gordon brown out of the treasury after the election,1.0,21.0
that depends on whether there still labour government and their majority,0.0,11.0
senior mps are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of labour backbenchers on monday,0.0,22.0

fresh speculation of rift recently followed mr blair and mr brown separate responses to the asian tsunami,1.0,17.0

the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the plp and were seemingly in good spirits as it started,0.0,27.0

mr blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while mr brown says he will not let gossip distract him from helping unified election campaign,1.0,28.0
the conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the liberal democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government,0.0,22.0
if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at general election,1.0,24.0
and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during meeting of the parliamentary labour party,0.0,26.0
the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election,1.0,40.0
as one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting it is time they realised it not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt,1.0,35.0
it is sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand,0.0,33.0
as paul flynn said what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respect,1.0,60.0
stephen pound echoed the message saying we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve not for the labour party but for this country is the appearance of division,0.0,36.0
they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be named and shamed,0.0,23.0
the dressing down appears to have done the trick with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown stead and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch,1.0,43.0
but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things,0.0,12.0
firstly nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors,0.0,29.0
even mr prescott admitted that had he still been backbencher he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message,1.0,23.0
secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has to all intents and purposes kicked off,0.0,19.0
but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good or can even be sustained through the campaign remains to be seen,0.0,31.0
even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that while mr brown is in africa for week the prime minister is to deliver keynote speech on election themes for third term,1.0,33.0
and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be new labour through and through,0.0,20.0
similarly some were pointing out that the chancellor during the election poster launch once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said,1.0,33.0
none the less what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp effectively strengthening the prime minister hand,1.0,31.0
for example will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister timing or subject matter as may have been the case in the past,0.0,28.0
what all seem agreed on however is that this sniping simply can not be allowed to go on through the election campaign,0.0,22.0

there was much forced smiling for the cameras but only mr prescott who revels in such occasions seemed to be truly enjoying himself,1.0,23.0
mr milburn made point of turning to face the chancellor as he spoke nodding thoughtfully,0.0,15.0

mr peston book claimed that mr brown told mr blair there is nothing you could ever say to me now that could ever believe,1.0,24.0
mr blair directly denied that quote on wednesday,1.0,8.0
he again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit,0.0,25.0
the tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor,0.0,16.0
he declared he is the deals on meals prime minister,0.0,10.0
no wonder the chancellor is not happy eater,0.0,8.0

the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made mr peston book,1.0,22.0
it become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they and their supporters need to grow up and stop bickering,0.0,27.0
but this analysis in fact gets it wrong,0.0,8.0
it not just children who fight adults do too,0.0,9.0
and there are solid reasons why even trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going,1.0,21.0
the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they be better off if it ended but everyone wants to have the last word,0.0,27.0
each participant genuinely wants the row to stop but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just tiny bit to ensure their view is heard,1.0,24.0
their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on,1.0,20.0
in the case of mr blair and mr brown successive books are published ensuring the issues never die,0.0,18.0
now this isn because the participants are stupid it actually each individual behaving entirely rationally given the incentives facing them,0.0,20.0
indeed there even piece of economic theory that explains all this,0.0,11.0
nothing as obscure as post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quoted but ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with,0.0,28.0
it often referred to as the prisoner dilemma based on parable much told in economics degree courses about sheriff and two prisoners,1.0,22.0
the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with heinous crime and are locked up in separate cells,0.0,19.0
but the sheriff desperately needs confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime,1.0,22.0
without confession the prisoners will get minimal sentence on some trumped up charge,0.0,13.0
clearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk,0.0,28.0
he tells each prisoner separately that if they confess and they are the only one to confess they ll be let off their crime,1.0,24.0
and he tells them that if they don confess and they are the only one not to confess they ll get life,1.0,22.0
now if you are prisoner confronted with this choice your best bet is to confess,1.0,15.0
if your partner doesn confess you ll get off completely,1.0,10.0
and if your partner does confess you better confess to ensure you don get life,1.0,15.0
the result is of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff does not have to let either one off,1.0,19.0
both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up,1.0,24.0
"don worry if you don entirely follow it you can to look it up on google where there are 283,000 entries on it",0.0,23.0
the prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades,0.0,17.0
it is parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly,0.0,30.0
cold war arms race for example classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just few arms rather than lot of arms,0.0,26.0
but as long as each wants just few more arms than the other an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms results in arms levels that are too high,0.0,37.0
what economics tells us is that once you re in prisoners dilemma unless you are repeating the experience many times over it hard to escape the perverse logic of it,0.0,30.0
it no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on,1.0,23.0
somehow the incentives have to change,0.0,6.0
in the case of the labour party if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest solomon wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem,0.0,34.0
every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants,0.0,17.0
an example is the famous rule that one divides the other chooses as way of allocating piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children,0.0,26.0
in the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row,1.0,40.0
the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing or one more book for that matter has to exceed the benefit of having the last word and getting your point in,1.0,33.0

the prime minister used his speech to selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto,1.0,21.0
there was detailed account of the government past record with major emphasis on the economy and public services,0.0,18.0
there was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with chancellor gordon brown,0.0,18.0
and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly new labour although that may continue to irritate his chancellor,1.0,26.0
there was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges although the prime minister talked about new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society,1.0,32.0
his was more speech designed to remind people and some in his own party precisely what new labour stood for and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach,1.0,37.0
and for some that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something that it is as he said more than an electoral device,0.0,25.0
to that end he set out broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it possibly through some gritted teeth in 2001 and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters,0.0,43.0

under what is to be the general election slogan britain is working the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour,1.0,27.0
that might get under the skin of mr brown but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post-war chancellor britain has had,0.0,25.0
probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men in so far as there is one is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services,0.0,28.0
an unremittingly new labour manifesto as the prime minister is happy to make plain will stress the importance of that the belief patients and parents for example want choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them,1.0,41.0
the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle,0.0,22.0
with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and in particular the use of that little three letter word,1.0,31.0

among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities,0.0,15.0
tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive,1.0,15.0
the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies such as boards tackling industrial development and housing,0.0,18.0
their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government,0.0,12.0
the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people rather than officials run hospitals and surgeries,1.0,24.0
announcing the plans mr redwood said mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers and has broken the pledges he made,0.0,21.0
far from improving public services spending taxpayers money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats more regulation and higher taxes,0.0,21.0
his party leader michael howard argued change in direction was needed to get grip on spending,0.0,16.0
labour are creating two britains the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain he said,1.0,16.0
in the real world people are working harder just to stand still,0.0,12.0
they ve seen their pensions knocked for six,0.0,8.0
they re being squeezed by extra taxes,0.0,7.0
the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain,0.0,10.0
"the government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive",1.0,16.0
but chief secretary to the treasury paul boateng attacked the tory plans,0.0,12.0
the conservatives are committed to cutting labour public spending plans by massive 35 billion he said,1.0,16.0
cuts on this scale can not be found from cutting bureaucracy but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools hospitals and the police,0.0,27.0
the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services,1.0,20.0
peers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne,0.0,14.0
labour peer lord dubs succession to the crown bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister,0.0,29.0
the private member bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics,1.0,17.0
the fabian society sundar katwala said the change was long overdue and that he expected warm response,1.0,17.0
the political reform group general secretary told bbc radio today programme there were some very out-dated features at the heart of britain constitution,0.0,23.0
in 1998 the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures,0.0,29.0
we hope they are warm towards it and don say this is the wrong time,0.0,15.0
he pointed out that it was 30 years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill,1.0,23.0
mr katwala added this is long overdue,0.0,7.0
parliament will have to do it eventually the government and hope all of the political parties might think this is very simple thing to have in their manifestos,0.0,28.0
but he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election,1.0,31.0
he said he hoped the bill would be gentle nudge to the government and suggested it would demand response,1.0,19.0
the bill which is in the lords for its second reading has been adopted by former chief whip ann taylor in the commons,0.0,23.0
the rule of succession is regulated not only through descent and tradition but also by the act of settlement which confirmed in 1701 that it was for parliament to determine the title to the throne,1.0,35.0
by any measure new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else winner,0.0,16.0
this is the man who some pundits believe was almost single-handedly responsible for bill clinton sensational 1992 comeback victory,0.0,19.0
he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and more recently politicians from mexico to uruguay,1.0,21.0
now he is back in london as the uk independence party not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped you guessed it opposition candidate viktor yushchenko,0.0,29.0
if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances,0.0,19.0
that he enjoys the game more than the politics,0.0,9.0
so why britain and why ukip which despite its recent eu election successes is not likely to pull off sensational victory in the looming general election,1.0,26.0
on this subject morris appears almost evangelical,1.0,7.0
was on cruise in the mediterranean and coincidentally so was ukip leader roger knapman,1.0,14.0
had just written piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there,0.0,23.0
but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him,1.0,10.0
many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art irrespective of the politics,1.0,16.0
think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism,0.0,14.0
great soundbite but surprise coming from new yorker post 11 september,0.0,11.0
it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better who don believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined,0.0,29.0
that international bankers the world trade organisation the international monetary fund the world bank and primarily the european union,0.0,19.0
so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic,1.0,21.0
and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable,1.0,16.0
the tory party is schizophrenic about europe,0.0,7.0
but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they can possibly re-negotiate anything as michael howard is pledged to do,0.0,23.0
it like walking into liquor store with gun to rob it and saying before can proceed with the robbery want to make clear am not going to shoot anybody,0.0,29.0
possibly very american analogy but another great soundbite,0.0,8.0
the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain and we oppose that and the tories can not be trusted to oppose it,0.0,35.0
so is ukip job to destroy the tories as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declared,0.0,16.0
the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories spine on the issue by having large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move,1.0,49.0
but it not just to shift the tories,0.0,8.0
think ukip had huge amount to do with tony blair decision to hold referendum on the european constitution and think it had huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro,1.0,34.0
and while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites,1.0,20.0
robert kilroy silk is not team player it is good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one,0.0,21.0
so what is the big plan for the general election,1.0,10.0
how will he achieve the breakthrough,0.0,6.0
look we are not going to be forming the next government he said,0.0,13.0
neither does ukip have to fight every seat,1.0,8.0
as with the 2004 us presidential election he says the outcome will be decided by small number of swing seats just as he believes it will in britain,1.0,28.0
so with limited resources the aim is to target those seats and end the day with significant group in the commons,0.0,21.0
he also believes it is possible the internet could have big part in the poll,0.0,15.0
the internet was decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election through blogs individuals posting their views in online diaries,1.0,19.0
anything can happen in the next general election,1.0,8.0
there is an inherent instability at the moment,0.0,8.0
labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice,1.0,20.0
that might he suggests lead to hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power,0.0,17.0
but there is undoubtedly sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises even while most still believe it is labour for the taking,1.0,26.0
ukip performance in last year european elections was just such shocker and showed that mr morris may have point about the new consensus,1.0,23.0
and after all he has reputation to sustain,0.0,8.0
labour will continue to pursue controversial reforms if it wins third term in power the party election chief alan milburn has said,1.0,22.0
he pledged labour would encourage more people to achieve their aspirations,1.0,11.0
what we want is for more people to earn and own mr milburn told bbc radio today show,1.0,18.0
tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin called labour brilliant machine for talking about things but said it did not deliver policies the country needs,1.0,23.0
meanwhile the liberal democrats president simon hughes said new labour has lost people confidence in way old labour never did,1.0,20.0
mr milburn told today that labour wanted policies which encouraged increased social mobility in britain,1.0,15.0
pressed on incapacity benefits he said the tax and welfare system must provide the right incentives to people,1.0,18.0
no-one is talking about driving people into work but what we do know is there are one million people on incapacity benefit who want the opportunity to work providing the right level of support is there for them,0.0,38.0
however backbench labour mp karen buck warned against proposed changes in such benefits,0.0,13.0
she told the today programme if the policy is seen as being about how do you make the feckless poor go back to work then it is not going to work on the one hand,0.0,35.0
and it is not going to improve our electoral chances on the other,0.0,13.0
mr milburn also sought to draw line under the controversy about reports of feud between gordon brown and prime minister tony blair,0.0,22.0
he stressed that mr brown would play the same role that he did in the last election,0.0,17.0
mr milburn gave more details of planned reforms in speech to labour fabian society in which he also praised mr brown as one of the leaders of the party reform process,1.0,31.0
in the speech he backed choice in schools and hospitals wider home ownership and changes to the welfare system,0.0,19.0
mr milburn insisted that government reform must continue,1.0,8.0
our task is to rebuild the new labour coalition around one nation politics that recognise while life is hard for many all should have the chance to succeed he said,1.0,30.0
there is glass ceiling on opportunity in this country,0.0,9.0
in our first two terms we have raised it,0.0,9.0
in our third term we have to break it,0.0,9.0
voters turned on the party when it failed to reform industrial relations in the 1960s he also told his audience,0.0,20.0
oliver letwin said the government had failed to deliver in any of the key public services such as cleaner hospitals discipline in schools and putting more police on the streets,0.0,30.0
"he said ministers had not delivered cleaner hospitals with 5,000 people dying from infections last year",0.0,16.0
new labour had failed on school discipline because it had not implemented serious reforms so that teachers could run schools and which would give parents choice he went on,1.0,29.0
for the lib dems simon hughes said many pensioners are means tested for the money they needed and students who were told there wouldn be tuition fees and more debt have been given exactly the opposite,0.0,36.0
he added under new labour all households are still paying unfair council tax rather than fairer alternative,0.0,17.0
teenagers questioned for survey have shown little interest in politics and have little knowledge,0.0,14.0
only quarter of 14-16 year olds knew that labour was the government the tories were the official opposition and the lib dems were the third party,1.0,26.0
almost all could identify tony blair but only one in six knew who michael howard was and just one in 10 recognised charles kennedy,0.0,24.0
the icm survey interviewed 110 pupils for education watchdog ofsted,1.0,10.0
nearly half those pupils polled said it was not important for them to know more about what the political parties stand for,0.0,22.0
and of those questioned thought the conservatives were in power while of them believed the lib dems were,0.0,18.0
the survey also looked at issues of nationality,1.0,8.0
it found the union flag and fish and chips topped the list of symbols and foods associated with being british,0.0,20.0
many of the pupils also looked on themselves as english scottish or welsh rather than british while the notion of being european hardly occurred to anyone,1.0,26.0
defection timed to hit tax pledge,0.0,6.0
with impeccable and precisely-calculated timing tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard latest announcement on taxation and spending,0.0,26.0
with just about everyone in westminster now working towards may general election mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories resolutely depressing poll showings,1.0,34.0
the big idea is his 35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts,1.0,25.0
and it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the bbc one breakfast with frost programme,0.0,28.0
he and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now but without any concrete pledges,0.0,25.0
but mr howard announced that of the 35bn he has earmarked from savings 12bn will be used to plug labour claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin first budget,1.0,37.0
he would not be precise but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax,0.0,27.0
but he did for the first time say there would be such tax cuts,1.0,14.0
at this election people will have clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less,1.0,31.0
it is the tories attempt to open that famed clear blue water between them and the labour party and return to traditional tory agenda that will both reassure the middle england voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core conservative voters,0.0,42.0
so it is pretty safe bet to assume that when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact,1.0,37.0
these things happen from time to time,0.0,7.0
there are disagreements between robert jackson and me,0.0,8.0
the election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did he added,1.0,15.0
the election will be decided on the economy stupid,0.0,9.0
other issues like the iraq war and the trust thing will also play major part,0.0,15.0
but it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote,0.0,18.0
and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda,1.0,23.0
mr howard knows that risks accusations that as result he would slash public services so he has attempted to shoot that fox first,1.0,23.0
with polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts he has suggested that is exactly what he will do,0.0,29.0
whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen,0.0,14.0
tory leader michael howard says his party can save 35bn in government spending by tackling waste,1.0,16.0
the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes,1.0,25.0
the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps robert jackson former minister to labour,0.0,20.0
mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election,1.0,19.0
let be realistic the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did he told bbc breakfast with frost programme,0.0,26.0
however the defection on saturday has cast shadow over the launch of the conservatives spending plans,0.0,16.0
fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday,0.0,9.0
the bulk of the 35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services mr howard said,1.0,21.0
the 12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing he added,1.0,14.0
however the remainder would deal with some of the unfair taxes,0.0,11.0
almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes mr howard insisted,1.0,23.0
because borrowing is going up it is out of control that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both,0.0,24.0
so part of the 12bn we are going to apply to filling the government black hole reducing the borrowing,1.0,19.0
the rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today,0.0,22.0
mr howard is expected to say that around 6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday,1.0,22.0
the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter david james,0.0,16.0
home office spending could be cut by 1.6bn according to the final instalment of his year-long review,1.0,17.0
savings of 153m at the foreign office and 336m at the department for culture media and sport have also been identified,0.0,21.0
in all almost quarter of million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under mr james proposals,0.0,17.0
mr howard said all this adds up to bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less,1.0,46.0
however chief treasury secretary paul boateng said none of the tories figures add up so they can make these savings and can pay for any tax cuts which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is 35bn of cuts hitting frontline public services hard,1.0,45.0
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added people will not be taken in by michael howard claims of 35bn worth of savings,0.0,21.0
this can be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities,0.0,14.0
poll for the news of the world newspaper suggests the conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in century,0.0,21.0
labour will hold key marginal constituencies winning majority of 160 the populus survey suggests,0.0,14.0
and the liberal democrats will take three key seats from the conservatives leaving the tories with just 163 mps two less than they returned atlabour 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906,0.0,33.0
they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition,0.0,26.0
but the liberal democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour,1.0,28.0
as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as fading force,0.0,22.0
and he insisted there was no limit to his party ambitions in the coming poll,0.0,15.0
and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things,1.0,29.0
sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test,0.0,20.0
and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party westminster hq,0.0,20.0
he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election,0.0,25.0
the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson that only his party offered genuine alternative,1.0,30.0
on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives,1.0,31.0
"he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than 100,000 year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with local income tax",0.0,51.0
he was also happy to offer pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election,1.0,26.0
there was time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion,1.0,17.0
that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats,0.0,10.0
the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats,0.0,34.0
labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats,0.0,20.0
but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for more significant outcome than that,0.0,12.0
he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold,1.0,30.0
they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power,1.0,28.0
the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq,0.0,19.0
but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name,1.0,40.0
best person for top legal job,0.0,6.0
the best person for the job should be appointed lord chancellor and not necessarily lawyer or mp the courts minister has told mps,1.0,23.0
under reforms the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions,1.0,15.0
the lord chancellor no more needs to be lawyer than the secretary of health needs to be doctor said courts minister christopher leslie,1.0,23.0
the constitutional reform bill was entering its second reading on monday,0.0,11.0
mr leslie said the prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the house of lords or the house of commons,0.0,30.0
under the reforms the law lords will also be replaced as the uk highest legal authority by supreme court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers,0.0,31.0
in december the lords rejected plea by current lord chancellor lord falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be lawyer or peer,1.0,25.0
the peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers,1.0,18.0
the debate was carried over from the last parliamentary session but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the bill passed,0.0,27.0
mr leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called secretary of state for constitutional affairs or lord chancellor,1.0,20.0
he said what matters most is whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties,0.0,21.0
it is no longer appropriate for government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges,0.0,18.0
shadow attorney general dominic grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an exceptional institution providing champion of the independence of the judiciary,0.0,28.0
the government had initially proposed to take this institution and smash it to pieces mr grieve said,0.0,17.0
convention should be nurtured and celebrated but the government distrusted and disliked it instead,0.0,14.0
he warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining member of the house of lords the government would have great difficulty in getting the bill through parliament,1.0,30.0
former cabinet minister douglas hogg whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor said the bill was largely unnecessary bureaucratic and expensive,1.0,22.0
but the tory mp for sleaford and north hykeham admitted the lord chancellor role and office can not be frozen in aspic,0.0,22.0
the memory gordon brown says keeps returning to him the one that he says is burnt into him is that of 12 year-old girl whose parents died of aids and who is hiv positive herself,1.0,35.0
mr brown seems haunted by her eyes desolate of all hope,1.0,11.0
and then he talks of those eyes that do inspire optimism an extraordinary performance by schoolgirls of kenya largest slum advancing with crowded menace flicking their hips in manner almost as disturbing before the finale of clenched fist salute and shout of free education free education for all,0.0,48.0
mr brown message generally that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered,0.0,14.0
but he is such pivotal figure in british politics it is almost impossible not to ask him why he is doing this,1.0,22.0
his answer in part is because of the missionaries that used to come to his father church,0.0,17.0
ever since he says africa has been important to him,1.0,10.0
ve absolutely no doubt whatsoever this is heartfelt,0.0,8.0
but he also believes it is time for the world to see new gordon brown,1.0,15.0
not the dull reassuring bank manager but man driven by moral passion and it just so happens the labour party feels an awful lot happier ridding the world of debt than ridding the world of dictators,0.0,36.0
if mr blair won allow him to run the election campaign then he can at least pretend it was all getting tedious and he much rather be out examining social problems in the raw,0.0,34.0
it also goes some way to solving one of the overarching problems for all politicians of all parties scepticism sliding into cynicism about politics itself,1.0,25.0
if he can help the world poor just little then it shows politics isn worthless,0.0,15.0
but is his vision for africa too grand,0.0,8.0
can poverty in the continent really be halved,0.0,8.0
brown replies that no one thought the berlin wall would ever come down either,1.0,14.0
he still got to overcome not only the reluctance of other finance ministers in the world but also the cynicism of experts who wonder whether debt relief will just be squandered by governments that just won in the end spend wisely,1.0,41.0
michael howard has dismissed fears from some conservatives that his plans for 4bn tax cuts are too modest,1.0,18.0
he defended the package saying it was plan for the tories first budget and he hoped to be able to go further,0.0,22.0
the tories on monday highlighted 35bn in wasteful spending they would stop to allow tax cuts reduced borrowing and more spending on key services,1.0,24.0
labour and the liberal democrats say the party sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services,0.0,20.0
the tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party mps that mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals,1.0,28.0
now they have promised figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted,0.0,15.0
tory backbencher edward leigh said the proposals were step in the right direction but he told the financial times would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts,1.0,28.0
interviewed on bbc radio jeremy vine show mr howard said it is perfectly true that am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts,1.0,38.0
on the other side there are people who say we won be able to achieve these tax cuts,1.0,18.0
think we have got it about right,0.0,7.0
mr howard said voters faced clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes,1.0,27.0
he added would like to be able to do more and over time am sure we will be able to do more but at the start we have got to recognise there is limit to what we can do in one go in our first budget,0.0,46.0
have got to be responsible about this,0.0,7.0
the latest tory plans came as campaigning for the election widely expected in may gathered pace,0.0,16.0
the liberal democrats launched their pre-election platform with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition particularly on the iraq war council tax and university tuition fees,0.0,29.0

the party on tuesday challenged the tories to publish the full report from david james the trouble-shooter they asked to identify possible savings,0.0,23.0
but the tories are in turn demanding that tony blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election,1.0,22.0
the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds,1.0,24.0
duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its poor response to the asian tsunami crisis,1.0,17.0

mr bannatyne is due to host new television programme and is also appearing on bbc2 business start-up programme dragon den,0.0,20.0
but his spokesman insisted his attack on labour was not publicity stunt,0.0,12.0
in separate development robin cook gave his support to mr brown prime ministerial ambitions but told lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be labour election,0.0,28.0
but he insisted the recent squabbles between mr blair and mr brown were not perceived as problem by the voters adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence,1.0,28.0
mr cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was not an alternative source of opposition to the government,1.0,23.0
he warned the abstentions party was the real challenge to labour and they would not be motivated by mr blair promise to produce an unremittingly new labour election manifesto,1.0,29.0
his comments come after dave prentis the leader of britain biggest union unison told the daily record newspaper he wants date to be set for mr blair to be replaced as labour leader,0.0,33.0
howard and blair tax pledge clash,0.0,6.0
tony blair has said voters will have to wait for labour manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax,0.0,22.0
the premier was responding to challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its post-election budget,1.0,21.0
mr blair derided tory claims they could cut 35bn in wasteful spending saying the party had got its sums wrong,1.0,20.0
the two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre-election period,0.0,15.0
mr howard told mps that every independent expert from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the government was spending more than it is raising and labour chancellor would have to put up taxes,1.0,39.0
mr blair replied think they are wrong for this very simple reason that the treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right,0.0,23.0
the tories on monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth 4bn although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced,0.0,23.0
they also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services,0.0,16.0
labour and the liberal democrats have said the party sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services,1.0,21.0
but mr howard said voters faced clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes,1.0,28.0
the liberal democrats have also launched their pre-election platform with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition particularly on the iraq war council tax and university tuition fees,0.0,31.0
labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing fraudulent prospectus,0.0,23.0
so what is the gap between labour and the tories nowadays,1.0,11.0
one starbucks one rymans and one small greek cafe as it happens,1.0,12.0
both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories new headquarters in victoria street just down the road from the commons,1.0,35.0
that should make things little easier if and when the crack-of-dawn election press conferences kick off,0.0,16.0
unlike 2001 there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside or to buy scooters to get themselves between the tightly-timetabled events,0.0,27.0
and to all intents and purposes we already appear to be in that general election campaign,0.0,16.0
certainly the press conference hosted by election co-ordinator alan milburn in the rather compact new conference room still smelling of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffee mugs as yet unstained had all the hallmarks of an election event,1.0,41.0
welcome to the unremittingly new labour media centre he said,1.0,10.0
and ll bet he hadn checked that one with gordon brown,1.0,11.0
"along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfare-to-work scheme which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost 300,000 in unemployment",0.0,44.0
and they ridiculed the claims made on monday by michael howard that he could save 35 billion of labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering billion of tax cuts,0.0,34.0
labour has come up with figure of 22 billions worth of efficiency savings so understandably perhaps believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra 13 billion,0.0,29.0
these figures based on the two parties own detailed studies will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign,0.0,23.0
the lack of public outrage about the war on terror is powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups amnesty international chief has said,1.0,25.0
in lecture at the london school of economics irene khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 september 2001,0.0,25.0
she said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread moral message,1.0,19.0
and it had to fight poverty not just focus on political rights for elites,0.0,14.0
ms khan highlighted detentions without trial including those at the us camp at guantanamo bay in cuba and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems,0.0,29.0
what new challenge is the way in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war she said,1.0,26.0
by using the language of war human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war,1.0,23.0
ms khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world,0.0,19.0
the human rights movement faces crisis of faith in the value of human rights she said,1.0,16.0
that was accompanied by crisis of governance where the united nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account,0.0,21.0
the amnesty secretary-general said growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism,1.0,23.0
public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups she said,1.0,22.0
ms khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system,1.0,20.0
there needed to be drive to use simpler language talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes,0.0,24.0
such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world she said,0.0,15.0
the human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments,0.0,27.0
al-qaeda for example was not going to be impressed by traditional amnesty letter writing campaign,0.0,15.0
more also needed to be done to develop human rights framework for international business corporations,0.0,15.0
amnesty international members voted in 2001 to extend the organisation work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too,0.0,23.0
ms khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife,1.0,22.0
we would be an elitist bunch working for the elites for those who can not read the newspaper of their choice rather than those who can not read she said,0.0,30.0
despite her concerns ms khan dubbed herself hope-monger saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges,0.0,24.0

he understood that the best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights mr blair told the guardian newspaper,0.0,24.0
mr bush was sworn in at ceremony in washington dc on thursday,0.0,12.0
echoing the new us secretary of state condoleezza rice the prime minister said there has been clear evolution of us policy since the war in afghanistan in 2001,0.0,28.0

the prime minister conceded that the us had what appears to be harder position towards the state than europe,0.0,19.0
but the prime minister pointed out that until now the us had allowed britain france and germany to take the lead in trying to halt the iranian nuclear programme,0.0,29.0
following claims that us forces had worked inside iran to identify potential targets mr blair was asked if the sas had also been in the country,1.0,26.0
we never answer questions about special forces but do not take that as indicating an affirmative said mr blair,0.0,19.0
mr blair said he believed the president was keen to work with other countries while trying to spread democracy and human rights,1.0,22.0
it is significant in my view that he is coming to europe as his first foreign visit said mr blair,1.0,20.0
following his inauguration mr bush is due in europe at the end of january,0.0,14.0

ukip leader roger knapman said he would break open the champagne adding it was nice knowing him now goodbye,0.0,19.0
however he did say the ex-chat show host had been quite useful initially,0.0,13.0
he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye mr knapman told bbc radio today programme,1.0,46.0
mr knapman rejected the idea mr kilroy-silk posed threat to ukip and queried why he had failed to confirm rumours he was starting new political party,1.0,26.0
mr kilroy-silk explained his reasons to his east midlands constituents at meeting in hinckley leicestershire,0.0,15.0
his decision came as ukip officials began process which could have triggered mr kilroy-silk expulsion,0.0,15.0
it marks the end of his membership of ukip after just nine months,0.0,13.0
it began with flood of publicity which helped ukip into third place in last june european elections but became dominated by rancour as he tried to take over the party leadership,0.0,31.0
mr kilroy-silk accused his fellow ukip meps of being content with growing fat sitting on their backsides in brussels,1.0,19.0
he told bbc news 24 tried to change the party nagged all the way through the summer to do things to get moving because thought it was criminal what they were doing it was betrayal,0.0,35.0
mr kilroy-silk also told sky news there was masses of support for him to form new party something he has yet to confirm will happen,1.0,25.0
ukip won 12 seats and 16.1 of the vote at the european elections on the back of its call for the uk to leave the european union in his speech mr kilroy-silk says the result offered ukip an amazing opportunity but the party leadership had done nothing and gone awol,1.0,50.0
there were no policies no energy no vision and no spokespeople he said,0.0,13.0
the party is going nowhere and embarrassed with its allies in europe and ashamed to be member of the party said mr kilroy-silk,1.0,23.0
he said his conviction in britain right to govern itself had not changed,0.0,13.0
he would continue that campaign outside ukip when he contested the general election in an east midlands constituency,0.0,18.0

tony blair has launched an attack on conservative spending plans saying they are ludicrous improbability,0.0,15.0
the prime minister has told labour party gathering that the tory policies would cause economic failure,1.0,16.0
tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut 35bn in wasteful spending to allow 4bn in tax cuts,1.0,20.0
on saturday tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing inefficiencies which had burgeoned under labour,1.0,23.0
in his speech mr blair contrasted reformed labour party which had learned to occupy the political centre ground with hidebound tory party which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts,1.0,33.0
mr blair said the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk both britain hard-won economic stability the lowest mortgages inflation unemployment for decades and the key investment in public services,1.0,32.0
believe that the tory plans are as plain call to return to the past as it possible to imagine he said,0.0,21.0
it recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of conservative government,0.0,25.0
mr blair added they the conservatives have learned nothing,0.0,9.0
by contrast he said new labour had listened to its electorate and changed,0.0,13.0
mr blair went on to list his government achievements and to issue rallying call to the party,0.0,17.0
so now we have choice we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back,0.0,29.0
and say we have to fight,0.0,6.0
in response david davis said the tories would make cuts such as removing regional assemblies but would bring in more police officers and match labour spending on health and education,1.0,30.0
everybody knows having lived through this government the last seven years that they faced lots of stealth tactics lots of increases in taxes but no improvement in public services he said,0.0,31.0
mr davis said labour had been responsible for huge waste huge overspending not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy,1.0,21.0
the public face choice between more waste and more taxes with this government less waste and lower taxes with tory government he concluded,0.0,23.0
gordon brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors,0.0,9.0
the chancellor said the conservatives plans would see some 50bn in spending cuts by 2011 which the tories deny,1.0,19.0
mr brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be distracted or diverted,0.0,21.0
according to an advance text released by officials he told delegates we must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them,0.0,30.0
mr brown warned that the tories were planning the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto,0.0,19.0
meanwhile tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of misrepresenting the party proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans,1.0,23.0
he still can not accept the simple truth which is that we will spend more on what matters to people schools hospitals and police and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes mr letwin said,0.0,38.0
once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election which taxes will they put up to fill the 8bn shortfall in their plans,1.0,35.0
charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election,1.0,19.0
with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation,1.0,26.0
it is bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two,0.0,19.0
with his party previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government he has switched tack,1.0,28.0
"now he is promising to levy modest increase of the same amount on earnings over 100,000 year to allow him to finance series of pledges",0.0,25.0
they are to scrap student fees finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with local income tax,0.0,23.0
that last policy will also see about of the most well off paying more while others pensioners in particular will pay less,0.0,22.0
labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed,0.0,15.0
inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services,0.0,15.0
the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through 35bn efficiency savings while labour has offered 22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals although there is little chance they will propose increases,1.0,38.0
in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the 1980s and early 1990s,0.0,34.0
but unlike the old tory-labour debate he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services,1.0,27.0
that is view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts,0.0,21.0
similarly there is different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking michael howard proposals for quotas,1.0,34.0
once again with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration mr kennedy is stressing the different more liberal approach of his party,1.0,25.0
mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party election chances declaring the tories were not going to be significant players in the poll,1.0,25.0
he repeated his pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the election,0.0,15.0
mr kennedy went on to suggest the re-election of labour government with small majority would amount to massive vote of no confidence in tony blair government,0.0,26.0
that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in powerful even pivotal position in vastly different house of commons after the next election,0.0,27.0
it is dream the third party has dreamed many times before,0.0,11.0
charles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election,1.0,21.0
in his 22 years in the commons he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and he might say the uk political and electoral system,0.0,33.0
but even his caution can not hide the fact that this is party and leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in few months time,0.0,31.0
look have already said am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around he said,0.0,20.0
he still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another labour victory of some sort,0.0,17.0
and his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the lib dems as the real opposition,0.0,18.0
but doesn that lead to the jibe that his is party actively bidding to come second,0.0,16.0
he is prepared to go this far clear conclusion has been reached including by conservatives that the conservatives are not going to win this election,1.0,25.0
therefore the potential is there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election given that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win,1.0,41.0
this is really going to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experienced,1.0,18.0
but haven we been here before with suggestions in the 1980s that labour was finished,0.0,15.0
won voters looking for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives,0.0,14.0
the problem is that geographically the conservative party has melted away in about third of britain,0.0,16.0
we have supplanted them as the main alternative to labour in whole tracts of mainland britain,0.0,16.0
and they are party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary britain,0.0,28.0
mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters,1.0,27.0
"he insists his three headline commitments to be financed from tax increase on those earning over 100,000 year will appeal right across the political spectrum",0.0,25.0
they are to replace the council tax with local income tax provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees,0.0,23.0
he also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble similar policy did to old labour,1.0,26.0
think the tax argument has moved on lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election he said,1.0,22.0
under labour government the tax burden would have to rise while the tories plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible he claims,1.0,29.0
we are being straightforward with people saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies,1.0,41.0
that is clear cut choice for people one am very comfortable with and think will distinguish us from the others,0.0,20.0
as to his own future he is clear,0.0,8.0
if as expected his party increases its showing at the election he intends to go into the next parliament on the front foot with view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because see that as the decisive opportunity for us,1.0,45.0
that last remark reflects view gaining ground in westminster that if the tories do as badly as some fear the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party,1.0,33.0
perhaps then mr kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side,0.0,16.0
hague given up his pm ambition,0.0,6.0
former conservative leader william hague says he will not stand for the leadership again having given up his ambition to be prime minister,1.0,23.0
mr hague 43 told the daily telegraph he would now find life dominated by politics too boring and unfulfilling,1.0,19.0
mr hague who stepped down after his party 2001 election defeat does not rule out return to the front bench,0.0,20.0
he also told the paper he hopes to remain mp for richmond north yorks and start family with wife ffion,0.0,20.0
mr hague who recently had published the biography of william pitt the younger also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech-writing,0.0,23.0
he told the newspaper don know whether will ever go back on to the front but don rush me,0.0,19.0
asked if he would stand for the leadership again mr hague replied no,1.0,13.0
his determination to stay away from central role will disappoint some senior conservative members who say the party needs him,0.0,20.0
tim collins the shadow education secretary said last week it would be huge boost to the party if mr hague returned to the front bench,1.0,25.0
mr hague became an mp at 27 and leader of the opposition at 36,1.0,14.0
he said feel fortunate that by the age of 40 had crammed in an entire political career,0.0,17.0
had been in the cabinet and been leader of the party so now can branch out into other things it is very liberating feeling,0.0,24.0
mr hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister,1.0,15.0
maybe wasn as driven by politics as thought was he said,0.0,11.0

it is not that am cynical or just do not care,0.0,11.0
care about this country very much,0.0,6.0
but in the 66 years that have been alive there has not been one hour of one day of one month of one year when there has not been threat aimed at us,1.0,33.0
my point is the british have always coped without becoming dictatorship,0.0,11.0
we have coped with fear without becoming state based on fear we have coped with threat without turning our country into land of state threat,1.0,25.0
but that is what the blair government now seeks to do create tyranny to defend us from the al-qaeda tyranny,1.0,20.0
was born on 25 august 1938,0.0,6.0

to be protected from terror the government says we must become tyranny,1.0,12.0
but tyranny is based on the citizen terror,0.0,8.0
this is not victory this is defeat before shot is fired,0.0,11.0
an interesting article its good to see widening participation in the debate but suggest we move one step further,0.0,19.0
our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace because invading foreign nations imprisoning the innocent and hunting in the shadows can not destroy an evil of the mind and hatred within the heart,0.0,35.0
rather than focusing upon effect we should consider the cause because terrorism does not begin with bombs,0.0,17.0
why not try foreign policy of compassion it can only enhance our democracy and share our freedom,0.0,17.0
we really can deal with terrorism by turning britain into fascist state,0.0,12.0
what we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians,0.0,14.0
if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial there probably isn any,1.0,16.0
our security services behave like the detective who having decided that certain person is guilty rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it while the real villain gets away,0.0,35.0
remember there were no wmd in iraq,0.0,7.0
just because person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them terrorist,1.0,18.0
in this overly politically correct society it is good to see someone like mr. forsyth speak out,1.0,17.0
yes there has been oppression by the british government in the past and overstepping the mark in places like ireland but yes we are still democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge trial etc,1.0,37.0
apart from number of prisoners in belmarsh goal for example .this country signs up to human rights and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear the innocent people defined by whom,1.0,37.0
when id cards become mandatory the data collected will not be protected by the data protection act and will be readily available to people like gchq with no control by the person whose id is being checked,0.0,37.0
you can not compare the threats of past years with now,1.0,11.0
forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001,1.0,21.0
the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology,1.0,12.0
kilo of semtex will flatten building kilo of plutonium will flatten city,0.0,12.0
you now have combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible,1.0,18.0
agree the government is probably encouraging degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too,1.0,24.0
the problem with this issue is not that it isn important but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times that we will just let this go without telling the government no,1.0,38.0
however as the nation that gave the world the common law and true sense of the rights of individual liberty hope this will prove to be one step too far,1.0,30.0
as somebody of chinese origin can say that this country used to be good place to migrate and start new life,0.0,21.0
whilst life wasn perfect we could make better for ourselves,0.0,10.0
now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or can not do,0.0,17.0
we have to be politically-correct and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions,0.0,15.0
we have prime minister who spends too much time meddling in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of british citizens at home or abroad,0.0,30.0
mr forsyth has done good job in voicing his opinions,1.0,10.0
let hope the bbc doesn get gagged for letting people express their views,0.0,13.0
the people have the right to know and the bbc role is to inform educate and entertain,0.0,17.0
terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties,1.0,41.0
in the end the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy,0.0,25.0
yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate,0.0,17.0
the idea that the new terrorism demands new powers is erroneous,1.0,11.0
the evidence of any real terrorist capability in the uk is scant,0.0,12.0
ricin for example is dangerous poison but it is not weapon of mass destruction,0.0,14.0
what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear,1.0,24.0
if the government has its way with id cards tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not,1.0,34.0
we will have lost the precious freedom which bush and blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others,0.0,24.0
am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries the right not to be deprived of our liberty without trial in open court,1.0,40.0
that goes right back to magna carta and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they knew best,1.0,25.0
when you look at today britain you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing the date,1.0,18.0
the government is seeking to introduce police state,1.0,8.0
the new powers of home internment without trial follow pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years,1.0,47.0
an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in state of tense balance,1.0,40.0
these people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequence,1.0,13.0
the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it,1.0,28.0
because these terrorists are potentially so deadly we have to come up with new tougher responses,1.0,16.0
it will be little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nuked,1.0,24.0
we won have much of society left to debate,0.0,9.0
he correct in most of what he says,0.0,8.0
mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in northern ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young catholics to join the ira,0.0,28.0
administrative detention of muslims could have similar effect now,0.0,9.0
surely we the public would be better protected if the security services rather than alerting suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest and for how long,1.0,27.0
they were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent terrorist attack,1.0,21.0
don usually have much time for mr forsyth largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on,1.0,21.0
there is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the u.k. but it is very doubtful whether al-qaeda is global organisation co-ordinating this,0.0,30.0
the rise of surveillance cameras id cards the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times this is the stuff of nightmares,0.0,27.0
add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the home secretary and genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit,0.0,39.0
as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u.k. it government will soon have it people terrorised more that they could very achieve with few bombs,1.0,28.0
mr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation but could not verbalise,1.0,20.0
mr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides,1.0,27.0
he also forgets basic human rights were suspended then as now,0.0,11.0
experienced judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times,0.0,14.0
for very little return and maximum alienation,0.0,7.0
these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same,1.0,14.0
the nature of the current threat is new,1.0,8.0
it is no longer to our armed forces as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc was,0.0,17.0
the terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately,0.0,6.0
the best comparison is therefore the blitz 1941,0.0,8.0
at this time let us not forget suspects foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war without any complaints from the public,1.0,29.0
we must not forget we are at war,0.0,8.0
say that that the likelihood of an attack by sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against major uk target is when not an if probability,0.0,24.0
ll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn do enough to protect the uk,1.0,28.0
people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair,1.0,26.0
the very reason this country has been such wonderful place to live is under attack not from terrorists but from this government,1.0,22.0
the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the alleged terrorists are doing but from our own government,1.0,22.0
believe what this government is doing is at the very least highly questionable and at worst sinister,0.0,17.0
at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles when we are all tagged and monitored constantly,0.0,26.0
our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing,1.0,17.0
it should be of great concern to everyone,0.0,8.0
am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him,1.0,16.0
am against police state and would not like to think that lived in one,1.0,14.0
think that the attack on iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism,0.0,19.0
there are extremely worrying parallels between britain now and germany during the 30,0.0,13.0
never thought it would be so easy to take over country from within,0.0,13.0
mr forsyth has forgotten one key point the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler stalin and the ira all failed,1.0,24.0
as result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not,0.0,14.0
that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat that should always be the absolute last resort,1.0,26.0
but to meet the new threat to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today terrorists we may need to do things little differently,1.0,22.0
frederic forsythe comments seem to me to be well-thought-out analysis of why we human society as whole and britain in particular should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear,0.0,29.0
it is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end and terrorists can come in all forms as mr. forsythe opening comments suggest,1.0,25.0
am reminded of quote attributed to thomas jefferson,0.0,8.0
nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither,0.0,12.0
the government are faced with an incredibly difficult task and have made policy to deal with it,0.0,17.0
it all very well criticising that policy but if mr forsythe can draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative say so what,0.0,25.0
frederick forsyth rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable,0.0,9.0
he distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against new labour,0.0,11.0
this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights,1.0,15.0
it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist because he does not appreciate the need for balance,1.0,17.0
rarely find myself agreeing with my forsyth but in this instance think he is correct,0.0,15.0
the rule of law must prevail civil liberties are worth defending,0.0,11.0
if the government can hold suspects without charge or trial what next,1.0,12.0
by introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror,0.0,16.0
our democratic system is not perfect but as churchill points out it is better than all the others that have been tried,0.0,22.0
terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom,0.0,20.0
do not usually agree with mr. forsyth but he is spot on here,1.0,13.0
the single biggest threat we face is that of government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose,1.0,25.0
totalitarianism always requires an outside threat justifying range of extraordinary powers leaders want,0.0,13.0
the british government is far greater threat that and terrorist organisation,1.0,11.0
although in principle agree with him frederick forsyth fails to address one key point- al-qaeda attacks though obviously there have been none yet in the uk seek to kill the maximum number of people,1.0,34.0
the ira wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement,0.0,20.0
yes agree with mr. forsyth views,1.0,6.0
do not believe the government plans are justified,0.0,8.0
there is over reaction to and the negative influence of the us president interpretation of democracy and freedom,0.0,18.0
he uses the same arguments that were current before the wwii the wars to liberate iraq afghanistan with syria and iran to come,0.0,23.0
we are leaving poor inheritance for the future generations,0.0,9.0
mr forsyth is wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs,1.0,13.0
the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests,1.0,13.0
thomas hobbes would be smiling in his grave at labour propositions,0.0,11.0
like new labour he called himself libertarian,1.0,7.0
like new labour he believed he was promoting the people best interests,1.0,12.0
but as forsythe criticises this government hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians,1.0,24.0
simply put he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty the liberty to live man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to supreme sovereign as protection against his fellow barbaric man,0.0,34.0
hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity and rightly so,0.0,10.0
hope new labour suffers the same treatment,0.0,7.0
the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy,1.0,11.0
they must not be allowed to get away with it,0.0,10.0
of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he wrong too about the country not becoming tyranny,1.0,23.0
has he forgotten about shoot to kill torture internment without trial collusion with loyalist death squads etc,0.0,17.0
my background is somewhat similar to freddie so am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments,0.0,17.0
we can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms,0.0,28.0
whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive it is unfortunately also the first step towards totalitarianism,0.0,23.0
who is to decide whom is suspect,0.0,7.0
who can have faith in the honesty integrity and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years,0.0,24.0
what is to stop false denunciations,0.0,6.0
what of those falsely accused who will lose their careers,0.0,10.0
will their children still go to school,0.0,7.0
it smacks to me of the methods of nazi germany stalin russia ceausescu romania the list goes on,0.0,18.0
it looks as if new dark age is coming,0.0,9.0
see that opinion on mr forsyth remarks are divided,0.0,9.0
the problem see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family only to people they don like or are scared of,1.0,31.0
but history has shown that if you have laws like that they always get abused by those in power,1.0,19.0
after all today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you,0.0,25.0
and that day you ll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice,0.0,14.0
our laws are such that you can not just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces you have to be shown to be deserving of it,0.0,28.0
if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period we are no better that those we are fighting,1.0,19.0
never thought it possible for me to agree with single word uttered by frederick forsyth but in wholehearted agreement with him on this one,1.0,24.0
we as nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda which of course also means we ll inherit most if not all of their total paranoia and allow our governments of any political persuasion incidentally to gradually and insidiously impose police state by well tried tested back door methods,0.0,53.0
grieve for the future of my children it no wonder they re adamant they don ever want any of their own,0.0,21.0
this government with much fanfare signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial,1.0,25.0
this puts it on par with the government of burma,1.0,10.0
like many of your respondents wouldn usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views share but in the instance of opposing charles clark proposals for house arrest agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth,1.0,33.0
just look at the facts our government along with the us invaded another sovereign country iraq by selecting intelligence that backed it case based on fear,1.0,26.0
the facts turned out to be very different,0.0,8.0
if individuals are treated in the same distorted way then we ve done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs,0.0,23.0
mr forsyth links islamic fundamentalism to the new threat,1.0,9.0
however it appears that he has misunderstood the term islamic fundamentalism,0.0,11.0
it should be pointed out that muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the qur aan and the teachings of the last prophet muhammad is an islamic fundamentalist,0.0,29.0
this person does not commit suicide in any shape or form nor does she he kill innocent women men and children,0.0,21.0
this person is self-reflective and constantly tries to better her his actions by being good to others,0.0,17.0
the people who mr forsyth labels the new threat are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam,1.0,20.0
they have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions,0.0,13.0
on top of that they claim to be following islam in its true form,0.0,14.0
being eight years older than frederick forsyth and survivor of the blitz on london it is easy to agree with him he is absolutely spot on,1.0,26.0
during the ira bombings there were massive explosions in canary wharf to the right of where write this and also to the left in the city of london,0.0,28.0
notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on prime minister thatcher in brighton and on later occupants of 10 downing street there was no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there has been on afghanistan and iraq,0.0,41.0
even when england was in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like,0.0,24.0
we have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including id cards which winston churchill decided had to go since he said the average bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities incidentally can still remember my old id card number,0.0,60.0
hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered,0.0,23.0
what can add to mr. forsyth eloquently put arguments except applause,0.0,11.0
well done that man for standing up and being counted in the war against tyranny,0.0,15.0
two of britain big trade unions could merge to form super union of two million members,0.0,16.0
the move by amicus and the transport and general workers union tgwu would be seen as bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers,1.0,25.0
"amicus has 1.2 million members and the tgwu has 800,000",1.0,10.0
any merger would have to be approved by the unions executives and their membership,1.0,14.0

uk independence party mep suggested germany saw the eu as an empire and was cheaper than using tanks new documentary has revealed,1.0,22.0
mike nattrass ukip deputy leader made the comments to an audience at meeting during last september hartlepool by-election campaign,0.0,19.0
but challenged on the remark he denied accusing germany of using the eu as cover for 4th german reich,0.0,19.0
he says he was not german-bashing but saying peace was the eu founding aim,1.0,14.0
the meeting was shown in bbc film on ex-ukip mep robert kilroy-silk,1.0,12.0
the former chat show host quit the party earlier this month calling it joke,0.0,14.0
the documentary showed mr nattrass apparently talking about the eu telling the meeting the germans are the big losers here but they don care because to them the project is worthwhile,0.0,31.0
it like an empire for them spreading in all directions away from germany into hungary into what they call the sudetenland czechoslovakia places like that,0.0,25.0
so it cheaper for them to do it this way than roll the tanks in,0.0,15.0
on tuesday he told the bbc news website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with meps of different nationalities in the european parliament,0.0,28.0
he argued that peace was the only reason for having the outdated eu as there was no economic justification,1.0,19.0
pointing to germany trade interests as country in the centre of europe mr nattrass said the fact is that the eu benefits germany but it does not benefit britain,0.0,29.0
ukip spokesman said mike has some passionate beliefs and sometimes uses excessively colourful language with which to express them,0.0,19.0

london ukip mep gerard batten said robert has made variety of comments about ukip and its meps,0.0,17.0
there are of course two sides to every story,0.0,9.0

its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk,1.0,16.0
he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said,1.0,41.0
ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead,1.0,19.0
it the bnp in an expensive suit,0.0,7.0
it all well and good robert kilroy-silk claiming that veritas is party that doesn believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the two-horse race trend,1.0,52.0
in my opinion this is just publicity stunt which has just been used as smoke-screen for his anti-islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television,0.0,26.0
think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many,0.0,10.0
it really is time that the uk government ceased to be paper tiger on this issue,0.0,16.0
in addition as an ashfield constituent would be more than interested in kilroy -silk opposing geoff hoon,0.0,17.0
good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done,1.0,20.0
let hope kilroy-silk ukip and the euro-sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe,1.0,28.0
we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we as country want to go not running away from it,0.0,36.0

whatever kilroy-silk and ukip do none of their anti-european policies have any relevance outside middle england,1.0,16.0
this new party might gain support from right-wing england but will have little impact in wales or scotland,0.0,18.0
hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue,1.0,31.0

one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls,0.0,19.0
ve always thought that kilroy-silk was self-publicising egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion,0.0,18.0
brilliant about time this country had plausible party,1.0,8.0
having seen the recent bbc documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of number of senior ukip figures can well understand why kilroy-silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people,1.0,32.0

pro-europeans now have far less to worry about from the right,0.0,11.0

is this indicative of the man contradictory vain and pompous,0.0,10.0
think mr kilroy-silk has got very good point,1.0,8.0
british politics has become too pc and as result has no straight talking honest strong politicians,1.0,16.0

there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument,0.0,16.0
they will play key part in winning the country round to the idea of reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union,0.0,21.0

what other politician can claim this,0.0,6.0
have suspicion that he talks for larger part of the electorate that his critics would like,0.0,16.0
the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip,1.0,14.0
kilroy-silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip party list,1.0,14.0
he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament,0.0,15.0
while he clown and one man band at the moment he populist and that always dangerous.the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters that seems to be one of the factors in success,0.0,39.0
good luck to kilroy though think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting somewhat uphill battle,1.0,55.0
the man once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my country knight in shining armour,0.0,22.0

this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party,1.0,14.0
neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes,0.0,22.0
veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk,1.0,9.0
if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another,1.0,42.0
so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow,1.0,16.0

public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue lib dem leader charles kennedy has said,1.0,27.0
day ahead of the government pre-budget report mr kennedy used speech to say his party was facing up to painful economic realities,0.0,22.0

tough choices are needed in public spending,0.0,7.0
the lib dems would cut low priority spending including the government id cards scheme and the child trust fund,0.0,19.0

the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for 1p rise on income tax,1.0,20.0
now they say the only simple tax rise they want is new 50 tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down,0.0,39.0
there would also be local income tax to replace council tax and number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the polluter who pays,1.0,26.0

with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown the obvious unfairness of our current tax system especially the council tax and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down,1.0,42.0
he challenged the treasury to open up its books so the national audit office can report on the government performance,0.0,20.0
conservative co-chairman liam fox said liam fox said if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments,1.0,32.0

well it goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens,1.0,19.0
obviously there no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe,0.0,15.0
but want to remind you of few more events that made 2004 another year to remember or forget for athletics,0.0,20.0
one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly success in the 800m,1.0,12.0
winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be bit of formality,1.0,22.0
kelly had been full of should shouldn,0.0,7.0
thoughts about going for the double in athens,0.0,8.0
thought why wouldn you do the 800m it your best event,0.0,11.0
it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story,1.0,24.0
the victory for the british men 4x100m relay team was bit of surprise but great climax to the games,1.0,19.0
think the four of them jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis knew deep down that it was their best chance of medal,0.0,25.0
the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake,1.0,24.0
hicham el guerrouj olympic double is much bigger achievement than kelly on global scale,0.0,14.0
"he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles",1.0,17.0
"as soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and had finished commentating jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him big hug",0.0,30.0
he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories,0.0,26.0
hicham is someone enjoy having bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good,0.0,20.0
what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well,1.0,24.0
there were set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce very dramatic ending which think has been greatly misunderstood,0.0,20.0
"dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise",1.0,22.0
that was her heart and not her head reacting,1.0,9.0
paula had lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day,1.0,15.0
things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her,0.0,24.0
think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained,0.0,13.0
and if even the smallest thing doesn feel right when you are preparing to race marathon 10 miles down the road it will hit you like brick wall,0.0,28.0
the positive thing to take from paula olympics it that she will have learned lot from it and so will lot of people including me,0.0,25.0
purely as race paula victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling,0.0,20.0
it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya susan chepkemei and you don usually get that kind of excitement in marathons,0.0,21.0
it was also real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability,1.0,21.0
and it was bit of rarity for me too because genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out,1.0,24.0
kelly and the 4x100m boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team,0.0,18.0
we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level,0.0,20.0
the only individual men finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m,1.0,14.0
am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed,0.0,12.0
and that where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy,1.0,26.0
dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb,1.0,16.0
the thing is if we don have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn look good for the beijing olympics and beyond,1.0,27.0
tell you what really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march,0.0,18.0
in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve,0.0,18.0
so to have an australian come up and deliver such surprise was something special,1.0,14.0
to be honest getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco,0.0,12.0
just wish the whole thing would come to head so we can move on,0.0,14.0
having said that always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning blind eye anymore,0.0,26.0
and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle,1.0,19.0
we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats,0.0,15.0
as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for while,0.0,21.0
the bottom line is we can not keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it,0.0,23.0
sprinter michelle collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after hearing at the north american court of arbitration for sport cas,1.0,23.0

collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time,0.0,19.0
so far total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the balco doping scandal,1.0,19.0
world record holder tim montgomery is also facing lifetime ban after being charged by the usada,0.0,16.0
his hearing before the csa has been rescheduled for june next year,0.0,12.0
drug enforcement chiefs in the us have vowed to crack down on cheats,0.0,13.0
usada chief executive officer terry madden said the action taken against collins was further proof of that,1.0,17.0
the cas panel decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of usada ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of us athletes that compete drug-free said madden,0.0,36.0
the usada has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into balco rather than test results,1.0,20.0
the san francisco-based balco laboratory faces steroid distribution and money laundering charges,0.0,12.0
the trial is expected to open next march,0.0,8.0
an investigation into doping claims against marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee,1.0,16.0
ioc president jacques rogge has set up disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte of balco laboratories,0.0,19.0
jones who says she is innocent could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the sydney olympics,1.0,24.0
but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that hoping only that the truth will emerge,0.0,18.0
any decision on the medals would be taken by the ioc executive board and could hinge on interpretation of rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing,0.0,35.0
the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago but world anti-doping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now,1.0,30.0
we will find way to deal with that pound said,0.0,10.0
in statement released through her attorney rich nichols jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared,0.0,18.0
victor conte allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward she said,1.0,25.0
conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has record of issuing contradictory inconsistent statements,0.0,16.0
former olympic champion michael johnson has accused britain top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition,1.0,15.0
at the moment the biggest factor on the mind of british sprinters is to be number one in britain the world 200m and 400m record holder told five live,1.0,29.0
athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show little more pride,0.0,17.0
however linford christie countered it easy to criticise when you haven gone through the system here,0.0,16.0
johnson was involved in verbal spat with britain darren campbell earlier this year,0.0,13.0
the american had cast doubt on campbell claims he had torn hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the olympic 100m and 200m finals,0.0,26.0
and the american remains highly critical of aspects of british sprinting,1.0,11.0
the only time you see british sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is debate as to which one is better than the other he claimed,1.0,27.0
athletes here have to compete more outside the uk,0.0,9.0
their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top british sprinter,1.0,21.0
speaking at an elite coaches conference in birmingham johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in britain it had not necessarily reaped the rewards,1.0,30.0
you can fix everything with money he admitted,0.0,8.0
you contrast the situation here to that of some us athletes who have no funding,0.0,15.0
those who aren funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is lot more difficult and challenging,0.0,21.0
so when they get to the top they are more appreciative,0.0,11.0
this won go down as one of the greatest marathons of paula career,0.0,13.0
but as test of character it was the toughest race she ever taken part in,0.0,15.0
win in the new york marathon doesn make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year,0.0,29.0
if paula last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism,1.0,22.0
she can now draw line under this year and make plans about her future,0.0,14.0
even if she lost this race there would have been lot of positives to take out of it,1.0,18.0
she knows she can dig deep if she needs to,0.0,10.0
it was strong field with number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning,1.0,17.0
and although two hours 23 minutes wasn one of paula best times it wasn far off the record on difficult course,0.0,21.0
was speaking to paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing no-win situation,1.0,22.0
she thought that if she won people would say why couldn she do that in athens,1.0,16.0
and if she lost people would say her career was over,1.0,11.0
"and lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in athens",1.0,29.0
but that was never on the cards,1.0,7.0
she might have been beaten but she would have kept running,0.0,11.0
the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions weren at play here,0.0,25.0
the only question was what position she could finish in,0.0,10.0
most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in paula mind,0.0,22.0
if she wasn confident she wouldn have run,0.0,8.0
after all if you re the best in the world at an event you ll always have expectations of winning,0.0,20.0

however under international olympic committee ioc rules athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event,0.0,23.0
jones who won five medals at the 2000 olympics denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over conte allegations,1.0,22.0

bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race,1.0,12.0
the ability to run gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete belief that they can do it,0.0,18.0
every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it are you strong enough to finish,0.0,20.0
the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances,0.0,21.0
sports psychologist hugh richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer potential crisis of confidence,0.0,19.0
there is an old adage get straight back on the horse that threw you richards told bbc sport,1.0,18.0
paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens,1.0,18.0
she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is very effective strategy for distance running,0.0,18.0
if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness,0.0,13.0
she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment,0.0,10.0
for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york win or lose,1.0,21.0
if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong,0.0,13.0
but if she fails to triumph she risks being labelled has-been and her profile will suffer,0.0,16.0
and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues,0.0,21.0
athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions explains richards who has worked with past olympians,0.0,23.0
she must not get caught up in someone else agenda,0.0,10.0

and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the 34-year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the don know box,1.0,25.0
holmes has now pulled out of this weekend european indoor championships where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m because of hamstring injury,1.0,25.0
but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore,0.0,22.0
well it lot easier being the double olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram,0.0,33.0
you have to have real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you re very talented,0.0,18.0
holmes drive and determination have always been unquestionable that is the reason she has battled back from string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed,1.0,29.0
but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself,0.0,12.0
will have as much commitment desire and energy to go through major championship,0.0,13.0
holmes asked in the new year,1.0,6.0
at 34 holmes will also be aware that time is running out,1.0,12.0
us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson five-time olympic gold medallist retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britain double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson,0.0,26.0
the physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for holmes who has already admitted she doesn like the training anymore,1.0,23.0
whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating double olympic champion will spur her opponents on,0.0,17.0
holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten,1.0,12.0
unless she is certain she has strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track,0.0,19.0
but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs,0.0,21.0
the day after completing her double in athens the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title,0.0,21.0
holmes wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as first gold at the world championships in helsinki,0.0,36.0
there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes motivation the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens,0.0,32.0
on the other hand if those achievements can not be matched shouldn they be at least shared and celebrated,0.0,19.0
you don get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion agreed cram,1.0,22.0
you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it fantastic feeling,0.0,18.0
think deep down kelly wants to run,1.0,7.0
think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain,0.0,24.0
athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look kelly holmes tearing up the track again,1.0,19.0
after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire,0.0,11.0
so why is holmes dragging her heels about making decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again,1.0,20.0
she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next,0.0,13.0
she knows every time she makes pronouncement now it headline news,0.0,11.0
kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line,1.0,37.0
and if she decides not to run again no-one is going to turn round and say you re making the wrong decision,0.0,22.0
jason gardener fought all the way to the line to narrowly claim the men 60m title at the norwich union indoor trials and aaas championships,1.0,25.0
the world 60m champion got off to rolling start and had to dig deep to dip ahead of mark findlay and darren chin who both set personal bests,1.0,28.0
it was close race admitted gardener,0.0,6.0
stumbled out the blocks but my experience told through,0.0,9.0
still feel there more life in me and believe can go faster,0.0,12.0
gardener performance in sheffield could have been affected by the news which he heard before his semi-final that his european record had been broken frenchman ronald pognon who will be real threat at the european championships set new time of 6.45 one-hundreth of second faster than gardener previous mark,1.0,49.0
delivered powerful performance to take the women 60m title in 7.27 seconds,0.0,12.0

all the years ve been running and getting recognition,0.0,9.0
claxton time was also good enough to qualify for the european championships,1.0,12.0
the men 800m went to form in sheffield as,0.0,9.0
dominated the race from start to finish,0.0,7.0
the northern ireland athlete went off at startling pace but had to hold off the challenge of welshman jimmy watkins over the final 200m to win in one minute 47.96 seconds,0.0,31.0
both mcilory and watkins who set life-time best of 48.32 had already booked their places in madrid and were again well within the qualifying time,1.0,25.0
had to go out and go through all the gears before the europeans and won run again until then said mcilroy,0.0,21.0
could not reach the european mark in the women race as she crossed the line to win in 04.45,1.0,19.0
rounded off useful weekend with two more personal bests in sheffield,0.0,11.0
the 28-year-old reached 1.80m in the high jump and clocked 8.47secs in the heats of the 60m hurdles,0.0,18.0
starting to thrive on the pressure but if don perform then it not the end of the world,0.0,18.0
made winning return to major competition after drugs ban,0.0,9.0
the trafford athlete who has served two-year ban after testing positive for anabolic steroids clinched the title with championship record 4.25m,0.0,21.0
also set new championship mark in the men triple jump title in sheffield,1.0,13.0
the 26-year-old who has been training in australia over the winter landed 17.30m with his final effort the longest leap in the world this year,0.0,25.0

but this isn bad start and hopefully ll come back from madrid with gold medal,0.0,15.0

resumed their rivalry in the long jump competition both achieving the european standard,0.0,13.0
commonwealth champion morgan reached personal best of 7.96m on his very first jump and then promptly retired with bruised heel,0.0,20.0
olympian tomlinson tried to play catch up with his six jumps but had to settle for season best jump of 7.91m,0.0,21.0
was advised not to jump by my doctor and so pleased to come here and get the qualifying mark said tomlinson,1.0,21.0
now based at loughborough sprinted past front runner catherine murphy in the final 100m to steal the women 400m title,0.0,20.0
the 21-year-old ran personal best of 53.45 seconds to win her first indoor title,1.0,14.0
wall time was just short of the qualifying mark something murphy already has,1.0,13.0
took the men title in 46.46 ahead of promising channel islands decathlete dale garland,0.0,14.0
sudanese 18-year-old rabah yusuf who is seeking british citizenship showed his raw talent as he burst through in third,0.0,19.0
cleared the required 1.90m to qualify for the european championships and claim the aaas title in the women high jump,1.0,20.0
powered to new personal best of seven minutes 56.86 seconds to defend his aaas title in style,1.0,17.0
it was the first time in 11 years the eight-minute barrier has been broken at the championships and was just within the european mark,1.0,24.0
took the women 1500m aaas title in the absence of kelly holmes,1.0,12.0
her time of 19.11 was not good enough to qualify for madrid but ovens had already opted out of the championships,1.0,21.0
the men race was won by,1.0,6.0
who had to fight off closing pack to claim the title in 45.87,1.0,13.0
what have the european indoor trials told us,0.0,8.0
well think we could be heading to the european championships with half dozen medal prospects,1.0,15.0
it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around,1.0,25.0
the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton win in the 60m hurdles,1.0,16.0
running sub-eight seconds twice in week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up medal,0.0,26.0
but what was great about sunday performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted,1.0,20.0
diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah,1.0,21.0
and knowing that she got the better of diane in head-to-head race will give sarah confidence,0.0,16.0
in the men race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him,1.0,21.0
in fact the men 60m hurdles is so strong think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid,0.0,20.0
phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of 17.30m which puts him at the top of the world rankings,0.0,29.0
had chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there,1.0,17.0
he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has,1.0,19.0
lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is good performance,1.0,21.0
he is such huge talent but just needs some consistency and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further,0.0,23.0
across the board thought kelly sotherton had great weekend and continued to show she is developing,0.0,16.0
she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and 60m hurdles and you can ask for more than that,1.0,23.0
kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of medal on the basis of what we ve seen so far,0.0,31.0
she has complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well,0.0,21.0
it wasn all good news in sheffield,0.0,7.0
thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways,0.0,10.0
jason gardener may have won but he wasn at his best,0.0,11.0
chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him,1.0,13.0
he there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got big scalp out there,0.0,16.0
in the women race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka,1.0,15.0
the pair are enjoying bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with chest infection,0.0,16.0
if she had made the final think jeanette would have gone bit quicker,0.0,13.0
janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following two-year drugs ban,0.0,15.0
but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by long way and that shouldn be the case,0.0,26.0
the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition think that would help her,1.0,23.0
couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf,0.0,19.0
findlay is londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain,1.0,25.0
yusuf who came third in the 400m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship,0.0,18.0
he came to britain as high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent,0.0,19.0
so we shall have to see what happens to both of them,0.0,12.0
james mcilroy motored to the aaa indoor 800m title in sheffied on sunday in time of one minute 47.97 seconds,0.0,20.0

though if got lucky get close to the british record but blew up in the end,0.0,16.0

holmes had started the year in disappointing style falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite,1.0,24.0
her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m her first global title,1.0,26.0
just five days later the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m,0.0,13.0
it was the first time in 84 years briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double,1.0,15.0

he said it worth punt isn it,0.0,7.0

the programme does not permit both,0.0,6.0

record fails to lift lacklustre meet,0.0,6.0
yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham,1.0,30.0
and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking world record,0.0,16.0
apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and would just love her to put us out of our misery and have go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at time,1.0,36.0
athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and would like to see her have go at 5m in competition,1.0,27.0
"mind you every time she breaks the record she gets 30,000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it",0.0,20.0
world records aside thought it was very encouraging evening work for kelly holmes,1.0,13.0
she looked good and was very positive,1.0,7.0
agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the world top three 800m runners this season,0.0,21.0
yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last 200m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is bit of benchmark for kelly,1.0,30.0
my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasn convinced herself she is fit enough to do so,0.0,28.0
on the other hand think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men 60m in madrid,0.0,25.0
he started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners,0.0,14.0
jason has lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish,0.0,21.0
it would have been nice to see what mark lewis-francis could have done in the final if only he hadn got himself disqualified,0.0,23.0
he was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look bit silly,1.0,21.0
my view is you re meant to go when the gun goes and not before,0.0,15.0
and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again,0.0,23.0
having said that mark is looking in much better shape,0.0,10.0
but haven seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france ronald pognon who has run 6.45 seconds will be under threat at the europeans,0.0,26.0
from british point of view sarah claxton victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet,1.0,22.0
something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women national 400m race in new personal best of 52.98 seconds,0.0,22.0
aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have very strong 4x400m squad going to the european championships,0.0,22.0
scotland lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have real prospect of medal,0.0,16.0
"from an international perspective thought meseret defar was disappointing in the 3,000m but don think the pace-making was great",1.0,19.0
canadian heather hennigar set fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year shape she would have given defar real run for her money,1.0,32.0
she had go but just could not hang in there,1.0,10.0
we were also expecting bit more from bernard lagat in the men 1500m,0.0,13.0
but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and still think he is in great shape,1.0,25.0
as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti,1.0,11.0
but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season,0.0,15.0
it was very hot in the national indoor arena and felt uncomfortable in the commentary box,0.0,16.0
think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly,0.0,26.0
long jumper chris tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the european indoor championships,1.0,19.0
the 23-year-old has minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in madrid and lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in lanzarote,1.0,25.0
it nothing serious said his coach peter stanley,0.0,8.0
he strained muscle in his abdomen at the birmingham meeting but is back in full training,0.0,16.0
sprinter mark lewis-francis will also not compete in madrid on thursday,0.0,11.0
the birmingham athlete who clocked season best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in birmingham last week also prefers to focus his attentions on next month european indoor championships,1.0,28.0
lewis-francis who was runner-up to british team-mate jason gardener at the europeans three years ago will continue his training at home,0.0,21.0
meanwhile tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab spot on the podium in madrid,0.0,32.0
the middlesbrough athlete jumped season best of 7.95m at the birmingham grand prix good enough to push world indoor champion savante stringfellow into second,1.0,24.0

it was good to get out on the road for my long run on sunday,1.0,15.0
after the week had was bit concerned wouldn be able to complete it,1.0,13.0

such plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the northern irish fa howard wells at the next meeting of the four home countries,0.0,27.0
the english fa has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season,0.0,20.0

"was in italy for their friendly with russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20,000 fans turned up to watch",0.0,24.0
england were criticised for the 0-0 draw against holland the way scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies,0.0,22.0
you have to put performance on in friendly games,0.0,9.0
if you don they can be de-motivating,1.0,7.0
it can be dangerous road to go down if players don apply themselves in the manner they should,0.0,18.0

wayne rooney met gary neville cross to the near post with low shot which went in via deflection off richard dunne to put united ahead,1.0,25.0
seven minutes later the unfortunate dunne hooked volley over david james head and into his own net,0.0,17.0
steve mcmanaman wasted city best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half,1.0,17.0
in the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race,0.0,26.0
their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance paul scholes header over the bar,1.0,22.0
and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into tepid pattern,0.0,25.0
only shaun wright-phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems,0.0,19.0
wes brown also found wright-phillips to be difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline,0.0,18.0
wright-phillips sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered pin-point centre to the feet of mcmanaman,0.0,19.0
but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side-footing the easy chance wide,1.0,19.0
john shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him,0.0,20.0
he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the united attack,0.0,19.0
rooney was being well marshalled by dunne but that was all about to change,1.0,14.0
after the break united poured forward and there was renewed urgency about their play,1.0,14.0
and when neville delivered cross in carbon copy of city best first-half chance rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it even if he needed the help of dunne leg,1.0,29.0
worse was to come for dunne who had been having fine match,1.0,12.0
on 75 minutes he scored horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney cross and united seemed home and dry,0.0,21.0
however city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range,0.0,14.0
and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa,0.0,10.0
but united could have had third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post,0.0,15.0
manchester city boss kevin keegan we had great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial,1.0,23.0
we started off with good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace bit too much,0.0,18.0
but we still had four good chances two after we gone 2-0 down the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from,1.0,27.0
manchester united boss sir alex ferguson it wasn our best performance of the last three months but think we re deserved winners,0.0,22.0
at times especially in the first half we didn play with enough speed,0.0,13.0

the 24-year-old reds skipper spoke out ahead of tuesday first leg at home to bayer leverkusen in the last 16 which he will miss through suspension,0.0,26.0
let be realistic there are some fantastic teams left in the champions league he told bbc radio five live,1.0,19.0
we are just going to try to stay in as long as possible but we realise that maybe it is not our year this year,0.0,25.0
gerrard has made no secret of his desire to be involved in europe premier club competition,0.0,16.0
last season he described qualification for the champions league as the be all and end all and rumours persist that he will leave anfield if the reds fail to secure place in the competition,1.0,34.0
he has consistently been linked with move away from liverpool with chelsea the favourites to snap up the england midfielder,0.0,20.0
and blues boss jose mourinho backed gerrard view that rafael benitez team could struggle to progress this season,0.0,18.0
rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team maybe he little bit behind right now he told bbc radio five live,0.0,27.0
gerrard who fired liverpool into the last 16 of this season competition with brilliant goal in december win over olympiakos insisted he was still fully focused on helping liverpool to glory this season,0.0,33.0
the reds are currently fifth in the premiership table five points off the crucial fourth spot which brings champions league qualification and they face chelsea in sunday carling cup final,1.0,30.0
it big couple of months for liverpool he added,0.0,9.0
we re fighting for the fourth spot for the champions league for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions which are very important,1.0,27.0
we are confident we can upset chelsea in the carling cup final and get to the last eight of the champions league because financially it is big for the club and personally for myself it is very good,1.0,38.0
duff ruled out of barcelona clash,0.0,6.0
chelsea damien duff has been ruled out of wednesday champions league clash with barcelona at the nou camp,0.0,18.0

his injury is very painful so he is out,0.0,9.0

drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez header made for tense finale,0.0,15.0
it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager,0.0,14.0
yet it was controversial too after mourinho sending off apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans,0.0,22.0
there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took stunning lead inside the first minute,0.0,20.0
riise could not have connected any better with morientes cross as he smashed left-foot volley past petr cech,0.0,18.0
the goal the quickest-ever in league cup final stunned blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week,0.0,29.0
the blues attacking chances were limited and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard powerfully-struck drive and drogba low shot,0.0,20.0
despite their frustration chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool well-organised defence,0.0,16.0
joe cole had shot blocked and promising damien duff break was halted by good tackle from djimi traore but the reds reached half-time without any major scares,1.0,27.0
the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back,0.0,13.0
nevertheless liverpool were living dangerously and they needed fantastic double save from dudek on 54 minutes first at full stretch from gudjohnsen header then to smother william gallas follow-up,0.0,29.0
and despite chelsea possession it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced superb save from cech,1.0,26.0
and the blues increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with last-ditch tackle,1.0,25.0
but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later in the most unfortunate fashion as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level,1.0,32.0
that prompted mourinho reaction which saw him sent off but chelsea still pressed and duff had chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining,1.0,25.0
dudek saved bravely at the irishman feet while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time,0.0,20.0
drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post,1.0,20.0
but seconds after the half-time interval drogba made no mistake picking the ball up from glen johnson long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home,0.0,26.0
and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen cross in the 110th minute,0.0,22.0
there was still drama as nunez beat cech to high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level but despite liverpool desperate attacks chelsea clung on to win,1.0,30.0

wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos who ended fluid passing move with well-struck volley,0.0,14.0
but dyer had the last word in game of few chances pouncing on loose ball after alan shearer shot was blocked and firing into the top corner,1.0,27.0
neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game with plenty of tackles flying in but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by,0.0,28.0
bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half keeping out shearer low shot and dyer close-range header but that was the only goalmouth action of note,1.0,34.0
and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on 35 minutes,0.0,16.0
bowyer found space with neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out carr to his right,0.0,19.0
he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carr cross with downward header into the far corner,0.0,27.0
bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well,1.0,13.0
they were level within six minutes thanks to smart finish from giannakopoulos,0.0,12.0
jay-jay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed the greek striker found the bottom corner with first-time strike,0.0,33.0
the magpies were opened up again before half-time as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post,0.0,23.0
but the home side survived and they should have re-taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half,1.0,21.0
fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through,1.0,17.0
but the veteran defender escaped with booking as there were other defenders nearby and from the resultant free-kick laurent robert curled the ball just wide,0.0,25.0
bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies,1.0,14.0
their strategy seemed to be working until the 69th minute,0.0,10.0
alan shearer snap-shot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards,1.0,21.0
bolton boss sam allardyce am bitterly disappointed with the result but am probably more disappointed with the second-half performance,0.0,19.0
in the first half we had put them under lot of pressure and our goal matched theirs in quality,1.0,19.0
thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing lot of games but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half,0.0,29.0

shaun bartlett strike put charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before graham rushed onto queudrue pass to head home,1.0,24.0
the match burst to life from the whistle and charlton defender hermann hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes,1.0,23.0
hreidarsson received danny murphy free-kick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post,0.0,19.0
the iceland international looked such danger the boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him,0.0,18.0
charlton early pressure paid off when bartlett received long ball from talal el karkouri in the box and laid it off to holland who buried his right-footed strike,1.0,28.0
szilard nemeth recalled in place of joseph-desire job was twice denied his chance to get middlesbrough back on level terms by dean kiely,1.0,23.0
the striker played great one-two with jimmy floyd hasselbaink only to see kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing header straight into the keeper arms,1.0,28.0
boro had plenty of time on the ball but the addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure with kiely tipping hasselbaink header over the bar to take their lead into half-time,1.0,30.0
it was all one-way traffic after the break at the riverside as middlesbrough poured forward and kiely even saved hreidarsson blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent charlton own goal,1.0,32.0
but the addicks keeper could do nothing about riggott equaliser in the 74th minute,0.0,14.0
the boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of gareth southgate misdirected effort but despite the charlton protests his goal stood,1.0,25.0
the addicks did not let their heads drop and bartlett left the boro defence standing picking up hreidarsson cross to easily sink his right-footed strike,0.0,25.0
but substitute graham was on hand to grab share of the points for the home side,0.0,16.0
the 19-year-old striker nodding home the equaliser and his first premiership goal with five minutes left on the clock,1.0,19.0
felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre,0.0,15.0
we dominated after the break the players showed fantastic response and we should have gone on to win,0.0,18.0
but for charlton goalkeeper dean kiely who made three tremendous saves we could have scored five or six,1.0,18.0

clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through tremendous strike from bryson but the referee had already blown for foul by petrov,1.0,24.0
from the resulting free kick darren sheridan curled the ball round the celtic wall only for the post to deny him,1.0,21.0
back at the other end halliwell did well to come off his line and block bellamy effort to lift the ball over him,0.0,23.0
the keeper misjudged corner that stephane henchoz headed wide but similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal,0.0,22.0
the ball was delivered from the left and halliwell was left floundering as varga glanced the ball into the net,1.0,20.0
maloney replaced the injured sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after year out injured by helping his side take two-goal lead just after the break,0.0,30.0
the young striker fired free kick straight into the clyde wall but as he collected the rebound he was tripped by bryson and thompson converted the penalty,0.0,27.0
sheridan and bellamy were involved in something of flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee,0.0,22.0
juninho brought out another good save from halliwell and then petrov saw tremendous effort come off the top of the bar,0.0,21.0

lee miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds heading over colin meldrum and into the net from jamie mcallister free kick,1.0,21.0
mcallister himself scored the second when he met saul mikoliunas cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors,1.0,22.0
craig easton headed in controversial goal after an hour but hearts held on,1.0,13.0

mikoliunas sprinted down the right crossed to the back post where mcallister raced in to head past meldrum,1.0,18.0
moments later miller came close to grabbing his second with first-time drive from 16 yards which skimmed the bar,0.0,19.0
then mcallister picked up pass from stephen simmons and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past meldrum far post,0.0,21.0
the impressive mikoliunas twice went close before half time low drive was comfortably gathered by meldrum and then he curled left-footed shot past the keeper right-hand post,1.0,27.0
livi manager richard gough made three changes at the interval bringing on defender goran stanic midfielder gabor vincze and striker ferenc horvath for bahoken derek lilley and mark wilson,0.0,29.0
but in the opening stages of the second period little changed,0.0,11.0
however the west lothian side gave themselves lifeline with controversial goal,0.0,11.0
eric deloumeaux sent jason dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to mcpake who looked to be in an offside position,0.0,26.0
the livi striker ignored the pass however and dair ran on to it and played easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range,1.0,28.0
the home side called for offside against mcpake but referee alan freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle,1.0,20.0
livi went all out for the equaliser,0.0,7.0
in the 87th minute burton brien was hauled back at the edge of the box by neil macfarlane but dair sent his shot just inches wide,0.0,26.0

chelsea chief executive peter kenyon has played down reports that arjen robben will return for the champions league match against barcelona,0.0,21.0
he been responding well to treatment and started running on friday but we ll have to wait and see he told bbc five live sportsweek,0.0,25.0
we re looking to getting him back as soon as possible but he ll be back when it right for him and for us,0.0,24.0
there no plans at the moment around the barcelona game,0.0,10.0
his comments contradict those of chiropractor jean pierre meersseman who treated the dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of february,1.0,23.0
robben had been expected to be out for six weeks but meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital stamford bridge game on march,1.0,27.0
hope he can be back and will try to help him make that happen meersseman told the mail on sunday,1.0,20.0
put everything right with arjen foot the last time saw him 12 days ago,1.0,14.0
it was an obvious correction and easy to perform,0.0,9.0
know he was pleased with what did and now that he is running again,1.0,14.0
am due to see him one more time again in the next few days,0.0,14.0
meersseman is the medical co-ordinator at italian side ac milan,0.0,10.0
bridge could miss rest of season,0.0,6.0
chelsea left-back wayne bridge could miss the rest of the season with suspected broken ankle,1.0,15.0
the england international 24 was hurt in an innocuous challenge with alan shearer during the londoners fa cup defeat at newcastle on sunday,0.0,23.0
we think it big injury said jose mourinho whose chelsea team this week meet barcelona in the champions league and liverpool in the carling cup final,1.0,26.0
william gallas and damien duff could also miss the barcelona game,1.0,11.0
france defender gallas and ireland winger duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of chelsea 1-0 defeat at st james park,1.0,24.0
with bridge having gone off after mourinho used all three substitutes those knocks plus carlo cudicini red card meant chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players,0.0,27.0
cudicini would not have played against barcelona but had been promised game in the carling cup final although he will now miss the cardiff showpiece through suspension,1.0,27.0
the manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to barcelona even though he has few options to replace bridge at left-back,1.0,30.0
celestine babayaro left the club in january ironically to join newcastle and although gallas has deputised at left-back before he is struggling to be fit himself,0.0,26.0
it could be that paulo ferreira usually right-back is switched to left-back with glen johnson who ended the newcastle game in goal playing on the right,0.0,26.0
youngsters ben hudell joe keenan and sam tillen would be options should mourinho decide to call up replacement but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in champions league tie,0.0,32.0
bridge injury also means mourinho who reportedly wants to sign ashley cole from arsenal will not have specialist senior left-back for the run-in to the season,1.0,26.0
he bridge has no chance of playing against barcelona probably will not play against liverpool in the carling cup final and maybe not for the rest of the season he said,1.0,31.0
the medical department will try to do everything to recover gallas and duff,0.0,13.0
we will have to wait and see but won cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on tuesday,0.0,22.0
shearer said he was unsure what caused bridge injury,1.0,9.0
don think we even touched each other,0.0,7.0
by all accounts it pretty serious,0.0,6.0
went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best,0.0,13.0
mourinho whose team are chasing three trophies has already lost winger arjen robben to serious injury,1.0,16.0
listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt,0.0,17.0
but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future,1.0,25.0
he told bbc five live steven is above money,1.0,9.0
he is the future of liverpool,1.0,6.0
it doesn matter if it 30m 40m or 50m we will not accept offers,0.0,14.0
but we are also realistic enough to know we can keep steven against his will,1.0,15.0
on the subject of liverpool finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium,1.0,25.0
and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan,1.0,36.0
parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from similar role at the premier league,0.0,16.0
there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard,1.0,35.0
on the subject of liverpool captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid,0.0,13.0
ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes,0.0,15.0
he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale,1.0,33.0
but when asked if gerrard would be liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said sincerely hope he will be,1.0,23.0
we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build team around him,0.0,15.0
we crave success as much as he does,0.0,8.0
we know he ambitious and nobody can argue with that,0.0,10.0
think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he like to do anything else,1.0,18.0
we all want to see progress by next season,0.0,9.0
there are lot of other players who feel the same so we all have common aim,0.0,16.0
it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with 30m-plus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen,1.0,24.0
there have been lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths,0.0,16.0
it is suggested we had deal tied up last summer,0.0,10.0
we didn had an offer last summer parry explained,1.0,9.0
we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn want to sell him,1.0,23.0
in reality it didn go beyond that,0.0,7.0
maybe there will be an offer in the summer,0.0,9.0
our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial,1.0,38.0
you are not going to keep player like steven against his will,1.0,12.0
that just doesn work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way we ve decided to sell you is not on the agenda,1.0,33.0
parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in 2007,0.0,23.0
and he confessed arsenal 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought,0.0,26.0
he said have to say historically it is something have been against and have been on record as saying that but think the size of the arsenal deal is real eye-opener,0.0,31.0
would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn even been worth contemplating,1.0,21.0
but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow that interesting,0.0,20.0
my personal point of view is that would find it hell of lot more palatable than shared stadium,0.0,18.0
some liverpool fans would find such move highly controversial but parry countered recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team,1.0,38.0
if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it,0.0,12.0
think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship,0.0,24.0
think it would be remiss not to,1.0,7.0
that not to say we have made decision that we will go down that road but think it is clearly something we have to explore,0.0,25.0
on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east,1.0,25.0
that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board,0.0,23.0
he also accused liverpool of using him as stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as stalking horse,0.0,25.0
there no need and that is not the way we do business,0.0,12.0
we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004,0.0,10.0
think we came close to concluding deal in the summer but it didn happen,1.0,14.0
quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it,0.0,42.0
steve interest was taken very much on its own merits,0.0,10.0
his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold,0.0,21.0
the door isn closed on anything,0.0,6.0
we had perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year,0.0,9.0
we have common interest in making liverpool successful,0.0,8.0
that dream we all share so as far as concerned the door is not closed,0.0,15.0
would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him,1.0,14.0
as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really,0.0,15.0
don care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be,1.0,19.0
we can not let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality,0.0,12.0
through cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which think is the right thing to do,1.0,25.0
critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard,1.0,8.0
ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term,1.0,15.0
am hoping he doesn walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash,0.0,17.0
50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it,1.0,27.0
would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over 35m,0.0,12.0
parry statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer can not be construed as lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players,0.0,29.0
upping the ante is another smart move by parry,0.0,9.0
no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed,0.0,16.0
the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy,0.0,13.0
clearly if he isn then we would be foolish not to sell,1.0,12.0
the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non-champions league football,1.0,17.0
england coach sven-goran eriksson has revealed shaun wright-phillips will start against the netherlands,1.0,13.0
but wright-phillips will not make his first start for england playing on the left as had been widely expected,1.0,19.0
shaun wright-phillips will probably start the game said eriksson,1.0,9.0
but not going to start wright-phillips on the left,1.0,9.0
eriksson also revealed that wes brown will start alongside jamie carragher in the injury-hit centre of defence,0.0,17.0
when asked if brown and carragher would start eriksson replied could tell you yes,1.0,14.0
it blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries,0.0,13.0
on the other hand it good for carragher and brown to show what they can do at this level,0.0,19.0
the england coach said that he had been impressed by wright-phillips form for manchester city,0.0,15.0
he has been playing well all season and look forward to seeing him,0.0,13.0
and he added that andy johnson and stewart downing the other two new players in the squad would also get chance to impress,1.0,23.0
wright-phillips downing and johnson will start or get the chance to play some part,1.0,14.0
johnson was not in my plans year ago but he is doing great season and scoring lot of goals,0.0,19.0
downing is another one making great season,0.0,7.0
he is young talented and there are not too many left-footed players in the squad,0.0,15.0
chelsea winger arjen robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks,1.0,21.0
robben had an mri scan on the injury sustained during the premiership win at blackburn on monday,1.0,17.0
six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then need few more weeks to be completely fit again he told dutch newspaper algemeen dagblad,0.0,27.0
had feeling it was serious but because of the swelling it was impossible to make final diagnosis,0.0,17.0
the 21-year-old missed the first three months of the season with similar injury after challenge with roma olivier dacourt,0.0,19.0
and he added it felt different then last summer when had the same injury on my other foot,1.0,18.0
then could walk already after three days but stayed sidelined for long period,0.0,13.0
hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks,0.0,11.0
chelsea physio mike banks was hopeful that robben could return at some point in march,1.0,15.0
the fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month banks told the club website,0.0,16.0
one is chip on the side of his foot the other is small break on the third metatarsal,0.0,18.0
but this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last world cup and which has kept scott parker out for two months,1.0,27.0
david beckham suffered broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 world cup in korea and japan,0.0,18.0
robben who has been key part of the blues push for four trophies claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by blackburn midfielder aaron mokoena,1.0,29.0

felt it straight away after mokoena hit me with wild kick on my left foot,1.0,15.0
ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his 50th cap in wednesday friendly against hungary in cardiff,1.0,18.0
john toshack in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark,1.0,24.0

the manchester united winger won his first cap as 17-year-old in 1991 an away loss to germany and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31,0.0,28.0

chief executive parry is the man at the helm as liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history,1.0,20.0
"parry has to deliver new 60,000-seat stadium in stanley park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above 120m",1.0,19.0
he is also searching for an investment package of size and stature that will restore liverpool to their place at european football top table,0.0,24.0
but it is challenge that appears to sit easily with parry who has forged reputation as one of football most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling premier league,0.0,30.0
liverpool have not won the championship since 1990 fact that causes deep discomfort inside anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of chelsea manchester united and arsenal,0.0,31.0
throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain steven gerrard and you can see parry is man with lot on his plate,1.0,32.0
but in the comfort of conference room deep inside liverpool heartbeat the kop end parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead,0.0,26.0
he only dodged one question when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting liverpool polite smile deflected the inquiry,0.0,23.0
but to his credit he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business,0.0,22.0
by business he means becoming title challengers again and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to liverpool is parry mission,0.0,24.0
parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez,1.0,19.0
and his enthusiasm for the spaniard personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold,0.0,21.0
benitez early work has given parry renewed optimism about the years ahead,0.0,12.0
but it remains massive task at club with unique history and expectations,0.0,12.0
this will not come as news to parry lifelong liverpool supporter but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting,1.0,24.0
captain gerrard is central to liverpool plans and parry insistence that all offers will be refused is firm statement of intent,1.0,21.0
as ever the player will have the final say and parry acknowledges that but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish,1.0,29.0
in terms of the search for new investment hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in march 2004,0.0,20.0
thailand prime minister thaksin shiniwatra came and went while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan steve morgan,0.0,23.0
morgan had succession of bids rejected having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium,0.0,25.0
bbc sport understands morgan is still ready and willing to invest in liverpool and parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere,1.0,25.0
morgan however has had no formal contact with liverpool or their advisors since last december blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his 70m offer,0.0,27.0
he was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool,1.0,24.0
morgan will certainly not be making another call,0.0,8.0
so speculation continues about the new benefactor with trails leading to the middle east and america but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield,0.0,27.0
parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpool future but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea,0.0,21.0
he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium,1.0,25.0
parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up but there has been vital new development in north london that has re-shaped liverpool thinking,1.0,27.0
liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights but the realism of arsenal stunning 100m deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape,1.0,34.0
parry labelled the deal an eye-opener and admits liverpool would be missing trick not to explore the possibilities,1.0,18.0
he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just anfield but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain,1.0,38.0
would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him,1.0,14.0
as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really,0.0,15.0
don care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be,0.0,19.0
we can not let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality,0.0,12.0
through cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which think is the right thing to do,1.0,25.0
critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard,1.0,8.0
ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term,0.0,15.0
am hoping he doesn walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash,0.0,17.0
50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it,0.0,27.0
would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over 35m,0.0,12.0
parry statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer can not be construed as lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players,1.0,29.0
upping the ante is another smart move by parry,0.0,9.0
no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed,0.0,16.0
the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy,0.0,13.0
clearly if he isn then we would be foolish not to sell,0.0,12.0
the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non-champions league football,0.0,17.0
time to get tough on friendlies,0.0,6.0
for an international manager friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players,0.0,14.0
the only problem is that the game itself can often be farce,1.0,12.0
some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the 90 minutes at the end,1.0,27.0
would say it 50-50 whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so,1.0,30.0
it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured,1.0,20.0
but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for team to get better is by playing,0.0,23.0
the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil,1.0,23.0
often in friendlies though manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half,1.0,27.0
and it very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in side with few changes let alone whole team worth,0.0,22.0
the debate will rage on and not sure there is satisfactory solution,0.0,12.0
one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith,1.0,12.0
the new scotland manager has decided to have training camp instead of friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts,1.0,22.0
it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is canny manager,1.0,15.0
the players have had such hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers,0.0,32.0
if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever,0.0,22.0
john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get decent result against hungary,1.0,23.0
he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results,0.0,25.0
it extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies,0.0,9.0
if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes stat that can be used against you,0.0,19.0
england game against holland is good example,0.0,7.0
it looks like good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson,0.0,20.0
but you have got to remember sven-goran eriksson side were given lesson by spain in the last game they played,0.0,20.0
the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher chance to impress,0.0,20.0
for the club managers it will simply be case of waiting at home with fingers crossed,0.0,16.0
barcelona title hopes hit by loss,0.0,6.0
barcelona pursuit of the spanish title took blow on sunday as they fell to 2-0 defeat at home to atletico madrid,0.0,21.0
fernando torres gave athletico an ideal start with goal in the first minute,1.0,13.0
ronaldino wasted second-half chance to equalise for barca when he put penalty wide but torres made no such mistake with last-minute spot-kick,0.0,22.0
the defeat coupled with real madrid 4-0 win over espanyol on saturday reduces barca lead to four points,0.0,18.0
former everton midfielder thomas gravesen scored his first goal for real in the comfortable victory at the bernabeu,0.0,18.0
zinedine zidane had opened the scoring before raul bagged brace,0.0,10.0
gravesen who replaced zidane completed the scoring in the 84th minute with low shot,1.0,14.0
david beckham watched by sven-goran eriksson came off in the 67th minute with shoulder injury but should be fit for england game against holland,1.0,24.0
england team-mate michael owen came on for raul after 76 minutes with the game already won,1.0,16.0
real have now won six consecutive primera liga games since coach wanderley luxemburgo took charge,0.0,15.0
listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt,0.0,17.0
but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future,1.0,25.0
he told bbc five live steven is above money,1.0,9.0
he is the future of liverpool,1.0,6.0
it doesn matter if it 30m 40m or 50m we will not accept offers,0.0,14.0
but we are also realistic enough to know we can keep steven against his will,1.0,15.0
on the subject of liverpool finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium,1.0,25.0
and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan,1.0,36.0
parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from similar role at the premier league,0.0,16.0
there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard,1.0,35.0
on the subject of liverpool captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid,0.0,13.0
ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes,0.0,15.0
he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale,1.0,33.0
but when asked if gerrard would be liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said sincerely hope he will be,1.0,23.0
we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build team around him,0.0,15.0
we crave success as much as he does,0.0,8.0
we know he ambitious and nobody can argue with that,0.0,10.0
think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he like to do anything else,1.0,18.0
we all want to see progress by next season,0.0,9.0
there are lot of other players who feel the same so we all have common aim,0.0,16.0
it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with 30m-plus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen,1.0,24.0
there have been lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths,0.0,16.0
it is suggested we had deal tied up last summer,0.0,10.0
we didn had an offer last summer parry explained,1.0,9.0
we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn want to sell him,1.0,23.0
in reality it didn go beyond that,0.0,7.0
maybe there will be an offer in the summer,0.0,9.0
our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial,1.0,38.0
you are not going to keep player like steven against his will,1.0,12.0
that just doesn work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way we ve decided to sell you is not on the agenda,1.0,33.0
parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in 2007,0.0,23.0
and he confessed arsenal 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought,0.0,26.0
he said have to say historically it is something have been against and have been on record as saying that but think the size of the arsenal deal is real eye-opener,0.0,31.0
would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn even been worth contemplating,1.0,21.0
but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow that interesting,0.0,20.0
my personal point of view is that would find it hell of lot more palatable than shared stadium,0.0,18.0
some liverpool fans would find such move highly controversial but parry countered recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team,1.0,38.0
if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it,0.0,12.0
think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship,0.0,24.0
think it would be remiss not to,1.0,7.0
that not to say we have made decision that we will go down that road but think it is clearly something we have to explore,0.0,25.0
on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east,1.0,25.0
that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board,0.0,23.0
he also accused liverpool of using him as stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as stalking horse,0.0,25.0
there no need and that is not the way we do business,0.0,12.0
we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004,0.0,10.0
think we came close to concluding deal in the summer but it didn happen,1.0,14.0
quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it,0.0,42.0
steve interest was taken very much on its own merits,0.0,10.0
his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold,0.0,21.0
the door isn closed on anything,0.0,6.0
we had perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year,0.0,9.0
we have common interest in making liverpool successful,0.0,8.0
that dream we all share so as far as concerned the door is not closed,0.0,15.0
would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him,1.0,14.0
as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really,0.0,15.0
don care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be,1.0,19.0
we can not let that sum of money go despite gerrard quality,0.0,12.0
through cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which think is the right thing to do,1.0,25.0
critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard,1.0,8.0
ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term,1.0,15.0
am hoping he doesn walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash,0.0,17.0
50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it,1.0,27.0
would however be happy with gerrard transfer for any fee over 35m,0.0,12.0
parry statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer can not be construed as lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players,0.0,29.0
upping the ante is another smart move by parry,0.0,9.0

the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy,0.0,13.0
clearly if he isn then we would be foolish not to sell,1.0,12.0
the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non-champions league football,1.0,17.0
bees handed potential man utd tie,0.0,6.0
brentford face home tie against holders manchester united in the fa cup sixth round if they can come through their replay against southampton,1.0,23.0
the league one side held the saints at st mary in their fifth-round tie and were rewarded with potential draw against sir alex ferguson side,0.0,25.0
newcastle will be at home to either tottenham or nottingham forest,0.0,11.0
bolton host arsenal or sheffield united and leicester will visit the winners of the burnley and blackburn replay,1.0,18.0
the ties will be played on the weekend of 12-13 march,0.0,11.0
was delighted to be paired with united although he admitted they still have plenty of work to do to set up dream tie,1.0,23.0
we ve got our work cut out next tuesday but you can deny it exciting he said,0.0,17.0
it will probably be on television,0.0,6.0
we have financial problems and the revenue it could bring in would certainly help our situation,1.0,16.0
we re happy to be in the draw but we ve still got to beat premiership team,0.0,17.0
we ve got to beat southampton first and that going to be hard game but if we do there will be some celebration,0.0,23.0
welcomed the opportunity to face united,1.0,6.0
we re not counting on anything yet he said,0.0,9.0
it is obviously going to be difficult replay judging by the way brentford came back at us on saturday and the fact that united have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive,0.0,36.0
but ve been drawn against united so many times in cups and beaten them at both bournemouth and west ham,0.0,20.0
there are no easy ties in the fa cup and sure nobody is counting on one,1.0,16.0
england defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of tottenham ledley king from the squad to face holland,0.0,18.0
chelsea john terry and wayne bridge are also out leaving coach sven-goran eriksson with real problem for wednesday match at villa park,0.0,22.0
injured rio ferdinand and sol campbell were both left out of the squad and matthew upson has already pulled out,1.0,20.0
wes brown and jamie carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership,1.0,12.0
terry the captain of chelsea as they push for the premiership title would have been certain starter in the absence of campbell and ferdinand,0.0,24.0
but now he has pulled out with bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by carragher alongside brown,1.0,19.0
manchester united brown last played for england in the defeat by australia at upton park in february 2003,0.0,18.0
the 25-year-old was only called into the squad on sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of upson who has hamstring injury,1.0,23.0
and brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for england,0.0,16.0
king was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by england medical staff,0.0,16.0
eriksson has still not decided whether to call up any further back-up having already summoned phil neville after bridge pulled out with foot injury,1.0,24.0
rio ferdinand has said he is unsure of malcolm glazer motives after the american billionaire launched new offer to buy manchester united,1.0,22.0
the club have confirmed that the glazer family partnership have submitted proposals of third bid,1.0,15.0
lot of people want the club interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart said ferdinand,0.0,27.0
no one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table,0.0,12.0
the central defender added on bbc radio five live we will have to wait and see what glazer comes with,0.0,20.0
would like to see the situation resolved either way,0.0,9.0
think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals,0.0,17.0
the other stuff off the pitch takes the shine off what is going on the pitch,0.0,16.0
glazer currently owns 28.1 stake in the club and united statement to the stock exchange said the board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject,1.0,27.0
the board can confirm that it has now received detailed proposal subject to various pre-conditions which may form the basis of an offer for manchester united from glazer,1.0,28.0
further announcement will be made in due course,0.0,8.0
glazer previous bids for the club which united supporters opposed were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur,1.0,25.0
but it is believed that glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move,1.0,16.0
he will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own 28.9 of the club to succeed,0.0,22.0
but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake while fans remain opposed to his involvement,0.0,24.0

cole is in negotiations with the gunners over extending his current deal which ends in 2007,0.0,16.0
and his arsenal team-mate robert pires has urged the england left-back to stay at highbury,1.0,15.0
pires told the evening standard he has been at arsenal for ever,1.0,12.0
he is very attacking left-back and think he is enjoying his football because at arsenal he plays in an offensive team,0.0,21.0
am not sure he will get the same pleasure at chelsea even though they are doing so well at the moment,0.0,21.0
have built fantastic playing relationship with ashley,0.0,7.0
we play together so well we could do it with our eyes shut,0.0,13.0

dundee united manager ian mccall has won reprieve from the sack with chairman eddie thompson calling for an end to speculation over his future,1.0,24.0
it is understood that mccall would have been sacked if sheffield wednesday manager paul sturrock had been willing to return to tannadice,1.0,22.0
but sturrock has distanced himself from the position,0.0,8.0
we must get out of it through the efforts of current personnel said thompson,1.0,14.0
ian mccall and have had long and detailed talk about number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the league cup he added,1.0,30.0
however the continuing speculation is doing no one any good especially as we have several crucial games coming up,1.0,19.0
the minds of the coaching staff and the players have to be on those games and those games only,0.0,19.0
our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semi-final subject to the draw,0.0,33.0
all that matters at the present time is us all having total focus on the games ahead and positive series of results being achieved,0.0,24.0
dundee united players had expressed their solidarity with mccall after their side 3-0 scottish cup win over queen of the south,1.0,21.0
we want the boss to stay we don want someone else coming in said jim mcintyre,0.0,16.0
hopefully now he gets the chance to stay,0.0,8.0
keeper tony bullock echoed mcintyre sentiments,0.0,6.0
think all the boys are behind ian mccall he added,0.0,10.0
at the moment it is all speculation and we have got to rise above all that and do job on the pitch,0.0,22.0
on saturday sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with wednesday who are fourth in league one,1.0,17.0
ve only been here five months and don expect to be leaving very very soon he said,1.0,17.0
can appreciate the rumours because ve emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to dundee united,1.0,17.0
can assure you the timescale is not the right one,0.0,10.0
it dundee united is my team,1.0,6.0

newcastle boss graeme souness has reopened his dispute with craig bellamy after claiming the welshman was not good enough for the magpies,1.0,22.0
bellamy left newcastle to join celtic on loan after major row with souness,1.0,13.0
souness who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name said bellamy did not score enough goals the chap that just gone has scored 9.3 goals season in his time in senior football half of those weren even in the top flight said souness,1.0,44.0
that not good enough for striker at club like this,0.0,10.0
we need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on regular basis,0.0,14.0
bellamy turned down move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated,0.0,23.0
earlier in the week souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken hard line after bellamy accused him of lying,1.0,34.0
there are certain things you can forgive and forget said souness,1.0,11.0
but if been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job have after newcastle,0.0,29.0
he could then return to st james park and he says that he wants to,0.0,15.0

brave defensive display led by keeper david james helped manchester city hold the leaders chelsea,1.0,15.0
after quiet opening james denied damien duff jiri jarosik and mateja kezman while paul bosvelt cleared william gallas header off the line,1.0,22.0
robbie fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide,0.0,13.0
chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but james kept out frank lampard free-kick and superbly tipped the same player volley wide,1.0,25.0
city went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat chelsea this season,0.0,20.0
and there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as chelsea deprived of arjen robben and didier drogba through injury struggled to pose much of threat,0.0,29.0
indeed it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven drab opening played at lethargic pace,0.0,16.0
shaun wright-phillips watched by england boss sven-goran eriksson showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver dangerous ball which was blocked by john terry,0.0,30.0
but chelsea suddenly stepped up gear and created flurry of chances,0.0,11.0
first duff got round ben thatcher and blasted in shot that james parried to kezman who turned the ball wide,1.0,20.0
soon afterwards jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head lampard corner goalwards but james tipped the ball over,1.0,20.0
chelsea were now looking more like premiership leaders and james kept out kezman fierce drive before bosvelt and james combined to clear gallas header from duff corner,1.0,27.0
city broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of frenetic spell should have resulted in fowler celebrating his 150th premiership goal,0.0,23.0
wright-phillips raced down the left and crossed to fowler but city lone man up front left free by terry slip contrived to head wide when it seemed breakthrough was certain,0.0,30.0
the second half started as quietly as the first although james was forced to divert cross from the lively duff away from eidur gudjohnsen path,1.0,25.0
there was nasty moment for petr cech looking for ninth straight clean sheet in the league when series of ricochets saw fowler chase loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the czech republic stopper,0.0,36.0
another quiet spell followed which duff interrupted with surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by bosvelt,1.0,23.0
lampard stepped up to blast shot through the wall and james somehow blocked it with his legs,0.0,17.0
another timely challenge this time from richard dunne in time added on prevented gudjohnsen from getting in shot,0.0,18.0
there was still time for james to produce sensational save to tip lampard volley round the post,1.0,17.0

we had two uefa officials there and neither witnessed it,0.0,10.0
the referee dressing room was locked and he and his assistants were the only people allowed in,0.0,17.0
indeed it is the londoners who could be on the receiving end of any punishment after failing to turn up for the compulsory press conference after the defeat,0.0,28.0
uefa delegate thomas giordano added the only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference,1.0,28.0
the referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to uefa weakening chelsea case,1.0,20.0
rijkaard was critical of mourinho decision not to speak to the media after the match,1.0,15.0
there was lot of talking before the game and now surprisingly there is lot of talking after the game,0.0,19.0
it is not good behaviour after match he said,1.0,9.0
maybe they want to start something and make it worse than than it is,0.0,14.0
barca midfielder deco formerly managed by mourinho at porto agreed that it was not typical of his fellow portuguese to lodge protest,0.0,22.0
it not normal behaviour on his part,0.0,7.0

it definitely part of me but who knows whether if or when ll be playing there again,0.0,17.0
owen who moved to the bernabeu from liverpool last summer has grabbed 11 goals for real but has been unable to replace raul or ronaldo in the starting line-up,0.0,29.0

when first came there was lot of scepticism back in england any maybe some out here he said,1.0,18.0
people were saying fourth-choice striker what are you going there for,0.0,11.0

but as much as our press like to build it up as if ve permanently had my backside on the bench ve played as many games as anyone else in the team this year,0.0,34.0
for fourth-choice striker at the start more than happy with the way ve settled in,1.0,15.0
recent speculation has linked owen with move back to england with newcastle expressing their interest but the england striker said he is not ready to return home,1.0,27.0
he added ve got nothing against the premiership mean that where first performed that where made my name,0.0,18.0

its great to have nice new surroundings but if the team aren performing on the pitch then there isn great respect in having fabulous stadium he said,1.0,27.0
it important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place before we began on the stadium,1.0,18.0
boss graeme souness felt newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the uefa cup against heerenveen,0.0,19.0
an early own goal followed by an alan shearer strike earned them 2-1 win and place in the uefa cup last 16,0.0,22.0
obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us great advantage he said after the 4-2 aggregate victory,0.0,19.0
we got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got goal and perhaps made us bit nervous,1.0,27.0
shearer goal moved him within 12 of jackie milburn club scoring record of 200 for the magpies,0.0,17.0
but souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season,1.0,25.0
think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway he added,1.0,17.0
he struck the ball very well he always has done and think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper,1.0,22.0
souness also paid tribute to laurent robert who was at the heart of much of united attacking play,0.0,18.0
in the first half he did really well and did everything you want from wide player,1.0,16.0

mcclaren was relieved to make it through after tough encounter at the riverside,1.0,13.0
to be fair to graz they had gameplan they knocked the ball forward especially in the first half and we struggled to deal with it,0.0,25.0
in the second half we were better but it was frustrating because we got the goal but one slip and they were back in it,1.0,25.0
boro face sporting lisbon for place in the quarter-finals after the portuguese side saw off feyenoord on thursday,1.0,18.0
and mcclaren added sporting are technically very good portuguese sides always are,1.0,12.0

it took bellamy just four minutes to threaten taking on marvin andrews before delivering low drive that was held by waterreus at the second attempt,1.0,25.0
he had an even better chance after hartson dispossesed sotiris kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat,0.0,23.0

waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to hartson just inside the box and the dutch goalkeeper made brave block,0.0,23.0
it was an old firm return for barry ferguson as mcleish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past hibernian,0.0,21.0
but rangers found celtic harder to break down and douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break,1.0,19.0

novo pounced on moments hesitation in the celtic defence to latch on to long ball from ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing douglas,0.0,25.0

for me it was not jerzy dudek fault added benitez,0.0,10.0
he had played very good game and had we scored our other chances nobody would be talking about about their goal,1.0,21.0
if we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal,1.0,17.0
in my opinion jerzy played well made two very fine saves and am happy with him,0.0,16.0
if we lose 2-0 we are out but think we can score in germany certainly one and that will make all the difference,0.0,23.0

milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957 while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name,0.0,20.0

feel we really turned in bad performance,0.0,7.0
at 3-0 we faced real struggle but 3-1 at least gives us chance,0.0,13.0
goalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals and wenger said we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment,1.0,27.0
wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself adding but there is enough time for crying,0.0,15.0
could cry maybe it would be easier but life goes on,0.0,11.0
in this job you have good and bad nights,0.0,9.0
this was bad night but still have confidence in the quality of my players as well as their spirit and desire,0.0,21.0

mourinho side were knocked out of the fa cup by newcastle last sunday before seeing barcelona secure 2-1 champions league first-leg lead in the nou camp,1.0,26.0
but he denied his club was suffering dip in form which league rivals arsenal and manchester united could exploit,0.0,19.0
they can not speak to us about blips because they re not in better position than us mourinho said,1.0,19.0
do they want to change positions with us,0.0,8.0
we are top of the league by nine points and in the carling cup final,0.0,15.0
the only thing they can say they are in better position than us in is the fa cup,1.0,18.0

former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have winter break but insists that gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite bid for champions league glory,1.0,35.0
hodgson now in charge at viking stavanger was at liverpool clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as member of uefa technical committee,0.0,24.0
hodgson is fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe although not in england where the champions league contenders have ploughed through heavy fixture list,1.0,26.0
but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last 16 of the champions league,0.0,33.0
just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have definite edge,0.0,21.0
am fervent supporter of the break,0.0,6.0
it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league,0.0,25.0
the other school of thought suggests having break then coming back to it puts you at disadvantage,0.0,17.0
the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february,1.0,41.0
hodgson believes winter break carries many advantages explaining as said it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries,1.0,18.0
and certainly if was still manager in england would be supporting any calls for its introduction,0.0,16.0
in pre-season you get lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled lot find themselves getting very jaded,0.0,38.0
the break gives them chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and perhaps more importantly recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead,1.0,29.0
the mental side is by far the most important thing,0.0,10.0
hodgson added the length of breaks can vary,1.0,8.0
in italy the break was very short,1.0,7.0
you just took christmas and new year,0.0,7.0
it was so short you didn do anything,0.0,8.0
you gave the players week or 10 days off then you were training for week or 10 days and then went into game,0.0,23.0
if it is longer it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them,0.0,29.0
and hodgson believes winter break would be positive step in the premiership,1.0,12.0
he said if we talk about football at elite level which the premiership is then would support winter break,1.0,19.0
if you examine the demands of the premier league and in particular on players who play international football for their club and country then break would do them the world of good physically and mentally,1.0,35.0

arsene wenger introduced quincy owusu-abeyie for the ineffective lupoli at half-time and the pacy dutch youngster had an immediate impact,0.0,20.0
he ran clear after good work by mathieu flamini but his finish was tame and kenny saved easily,0.0,18.0
owusu-abeyie then fired in testing cross which was met by fabregas and it needed desperate clearance by kenny legs to save the blades,1.0,23.0
arsenal were now totally dominant and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when fabregas crashed rising drive against the bar from 20 yards,0.0,28.0
it then took brilliant tackle by jagielka to deny ljungberg as he was poised to strike,0.0,16.0

the retention of their ever present premier league status must be the number one priority irrespective of the rewards that success against brentford would bring,1.0,25.0

they also knocked out the red devils in 1991 on penalties in the fourth round,0.0,15.0

we have sanctioned its use from the start of next season but only as long as it is the latest generation of artificial turf and meets whole series of standards,0.0,30.0

striker nicolas anelka reportedly wants to leave manchester city in search of champions league football,1.0,15.0
anelka 25 is in talks over contract extension beyond 2007 with city but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club,1.0,28.0
the news of the world reports that anelka told french magazine either decide to win titles or to have an easy life,1.0,22.0
think will always choose football if great club makes me an offer,0.0,12.0
he added to win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so,1.0,15.0
if we stagnate between eighth and 15th place it impossible to progress,0.0,12.0
if am going to score goals and not win there is risk it is going to create feeling of being fed up,0.0,22.0
anelka has earned reputation for being difficult character to handle after spells at arsenal real madrid and paris st germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him,0.0,31.0
am in talks to sign an extension to my contract he said,0.0,12.0
am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account,0.0,11.0
playing for eighth place is good but miss the champions league,1.0,11.0
won it with real madrid in 2000 and need to be playing in it and should be playing in it,1.0,20.0
not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football,0.0,19.0
tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of clash of personalities at white hart lane,1.0,21.0
there had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen role at the club,0.0,16.0
it is absolutely not true arnesen told bbc radio five live,1.0,11.0
there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems,0.0,16.0
he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself,1.0,14.0
arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge,1.0,23.0
he added jacques has never gone into exactly what it was,0.0,11.0
but trust him in that you have to accept it,0.0,10.0
the plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on monday we will clarify the situation,0.0,24.0
arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement coming less than 24 hours before tottenham premiership fixture with charlton,0.0,20.0
when it comes down to personal problems don think we should talk about timing he said,1.0,16.0
and he also denied reports that santini had been given 3m pay-off,0.0,12.0
he is the one who said will go and so he went said the spurs sporting director,1.0,17.0
tottenham structure of having sporting director working alongside coach is based on continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it,1.0,24.0
am confident that we have started something here in july and still have lot of confidence in tottenham and what we are doing he said,1.0,25.0
however former spurs and england defender gary stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused rift,0.0,20.0
think the problems go lot deeper between the director of football at white hart lane and santini stevens told five live,1.0,21.0
on paper they could have worked together,0.0,7.0
but frank arnesen was very creative forward-thinking and expansive player whereas think santini was very much the opposite more case of being organised disciplined and happy not conceding goals,1.0,29.0
that sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely,0.0,20.0
but it seems that has not happened,0.0,7.0
graeme souness believes walter smith would be the perfect choice to succeed berti vogts as scotland manager,1.0,17.0
souness former assistant at rangers is hot favourite to take over from vogts who resigned on monday,0.0,17.0
walter is most definitely the ideal candidate for that job,0.0,10.0
he be perfect for it souness told bbc sport,0.0,9.0
the scottish football association has appointed tommy burns as provisional caretaker-boss for the friendly against sweden on 17 november,1.0,19.0
he fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the scotland team and football,0.0,16.0
he is experienced and has been successful,0.0,7.0
souness added walter is real football person as know from working with him at ibrox,0.0,15.0
on top of all that he is proper human being who would command the instant respect of the players and everyone involved in scottish football,1.0,25.0
souness joined sir alex ferguson in backing smith claims,0.0,9.0
the scottish football association is about to embark on the search for vogts successor after appointing tommy burns in caretaker capacity,0.0,21.0
ferguson said he smith would be the outstanding candidate as far as concerned,1.0,13.0
you need somebody who knows what they re doing and walter would bring wealth of experience to the job,1.0,19.0
the man utd boss continued don know what credentials are needed to do the job but it job that needs lot of experience,0.0,23.0
he was my assistant with scotland and here at manchester united and he has also managed glasgow rangers,1.0,18.0
he would need to change the whole shape of scottish football and radical changes are needed,1.0,16.0
smith was assistant to ferguson at the world cup in mexico in 1986,1.0,13.0
the former everton and rangers boss has been out of the game since spell as manchester united assistant last term,0.0,20.0
bbc sport understands that smith would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the scottish fa,1.0,20.0
if he is tempted to take over it seems almost certain smith long-time right-hand man archie knox would also play part in the national team set-up,0.0,26.0
smith already has the backing of many pundits and fans including former scotland manager craig brown,1.0,16.0
brown said walter is an outstanding candidate without doubt,0.0,9.0
spoke to him on sunday and got the impression he would take it,0.0,13.0
he was asking me about it and was positive,0.0,9.0
other candidates for the job include former scotland midfielders gordon strachan and gary mcallister and vogts assistant tommy burns,1.0,19.0
chelsea william gallas believes they will battle it out with arsenal for the premiership in the coming months,0.0,18.0
it ll be two-horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything he told bbc sport,0.0,27.0
you need to be good and you need lot of luck,0.0,11.0
you need bit of both but it will be as hard for the arsenal players as it is for the chelsea boys,1.0,22.0
we know that we have got the power in our hands just now added gallas,0.0,15.0
but you never know what is going to happen in football two seasons ago manchester united picked up so many points towards the end of the season when they won the title,0.0,32.0
obviously nobody at chelsea wants to come second but you never know what happens in football,1.0,16.0
we will be challenging to come first as much as every arsenal player will be challenging to come first,1.0,19.0
gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager jose mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer,1.0,22.0
and the french international defender believes mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt,1.0,27.0
it only normal when you have got team put together of such big names that you put the finishing touch to it and the finishing touch at chelsea is fantastic manager like mourinho he said,0.0,35.0
he is the icing on the cake at the club,0.0,10.0
he has this fantastic knack of thinking of everything,0.0,9.0
another incredible quality that mourinho has is that every player even though the fans may consider them to be stars within the dressing-room they are absolutely equal,1.0,27.0
mourinho reminds everyone but he doesn have to because he has created wonderful atmosphere where everybody is playing and laughing every day,1.0,22.0
it is changed dressing-room from the atmosphere there was last year,0.0,11.0
some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil,1.0,17.0
he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige which he failed to live up to,0.0,18.0
he left an impression but not for reasons he would have wanted,0.0,12.0
the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play,0.0,19.0
even today gandula is the term used in brazil for ballboy,0.0,11.0
brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then and many will delight now if history is repeated,0.0,17.0
another boca juniors player is coming to brazil,1.0,8.0
the new maradona carlos tevez is joining corinthians for nearly 20m in strong candidate for the strangest move of the year,1.0,21.0
corinthians or the london-based company who have just entered into partnership with them appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez,1.0,23.0
it is particularly strange as until last week tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil where the argentine championship is not shown,1.0,25.0
presumably there is some financial logic behind the move,0.0,9.0
what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north rather than across the atlantic,0.0,20.0
argentina brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal,0.0,19.0
but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez,1.0,10.0
boca re-signed martin palermo forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role,1.0,13.0
and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be disorganized,0.0,25.0
hounded by the press tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires,1.0,13.0
so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of tranquillity,1.0,14.0
anyone acquainted with the city of 227 paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration,0.0,15.0
brazil biggest city is sprawling ugly restless metropolis,0.0,8.0
once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of city of italian immigrants,0.0,15.0
but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers,0.0,8.0
the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians,1.0,12.0
it is the most passionately supported club in brazil,1.0,9.0
pel 233 scored reams of goals against them reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own,0.0,27.0
that passion can also be turned against the team especially nowadays when the level of urban violence gives hysterical edge to life in brazil big cities,0.0,26.0
corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players,0.0,16.0
tevez then can kiss tranquillity goodbye,1.0,6.0
he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores south america champions league,0.0,13.0
indeed he will have long wait for worthwhile match,0.0,9.0
next year brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april,0.0,12.0
until then he will have to make do with the foolish 227 paulo state championship an appalling waste of his talent,0.0,21.0
there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina,0.0,24.0
like so many of the top south american players tevez has the gift of being able to surprise to feint right and go left to pass when he was expected to dribble to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares,1.0,39.0
but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all,0.0,11.0
arsenal brazilian midfielder edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him new contract,1.0,17.0
edu deal expires next summer and he has been linked with spanish trio real madrid barcelona and valencia,0.0,18.0
he told bbc sport not sure if want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far,1.0,23.0
if they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and that made me think,0.0,29.0
edu brother and representative amadeo fensao has previously said that arsenal current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking,0.0,24.0
and edu 26 added my brother is due to come to london on thursday,0.0,14.0
there is meeting planned for or january to sort it out with arsenal,0.0,13.0
now have choice to stay or go,0.0,7.0
want to sort it out as soon as possible that in the best interests of both the club and myself,1.0,20.0
going to make my decision after the meeting later this week,0.0,11.0
edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire,1.0,24.0
the midfielder who broke in to the brazilian national side in 2004 admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three spanish giants,0.0,26.0
edu said ve just heard stories from the news that the madrid president florentino perez the valencia people as well as barcelona are interested,1.0,24.0
that nice but ve never talked to them so can say they want me sign 100,1.0,16.0
last month wenger said he we was hopeful edu would sign new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of club like real madrid would be too strong for edu,1.0,31.0
edu added that he had been encouraged by wenger support for him,0.0,12.0
still have good relationship with arsene wenger he always said he wants me to sign,0.0,15.0
the worst kept secret in scottish football was revealed on thursday when walter smith was named as the new national manager,1.0,21.0
from the moment berti vogts miserable tenure in charge of scotland ended the former rangers and everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post,0.0,26.0
but is smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football,0.0,16.0
the 56-year-old takes over at time when the national side is in the doldrums,0.0,14.0
scotland have not reached major finals since the world cup in 1998 and reaching germany 2006 looks near impossible having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race,0.0,34.0
and the fifa rankings see scotland listed at an all time low of 77th below the likes of estonia ghana angola and thailand,0.0,23.0
scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level so smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources,1.0,25.0
smith track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game,0.0,14.0
the man who was alex ferguson assistant when scotland played at the 1986 world cup won seven league titles with rangers,1.0,21.0
and his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games top names including ferguson and graeme souness who took him to ibrox as his assistant in 1986,0.0,29.0
characters like souness ferguson and current ibrox manager alex mcleish all cite smith experience and his expansive knowledge of the scottish game,0.0,22.0
much was made of vogts inability to express himself to the players and media,1.0,14.0
that will certainly not be the case with smith,0.0,9.0
the former dundee united and dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better often with the use of some colourful invective,0.0,34.0
but it should be remembered vogts came to scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae world cup winner as player and european championships winner as manager,1.0,25.0
smith will inherit the same problems vogts had callow squad of players with no exceptional talents,1.0,16.0
and it remains to be seen if smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of vogts preparation work,1.0,22.0
fresh start for the scottish national team was imperative and smith is widely regarded as safe pair of hands,1.0,19.0
but will safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of magician might be required,0.0,17.0

don want my team to be too comfortable or too sure of victory as it is going to be difficult game,0.0,21.0
for me the main aim of the game is to enjoy and to win,0.0,14.0
zambia have shown their determination to win this final by recalling nine of their foreign-based players,1.0,16.0
however the 41 year-old bwalya who became the oldest player to appear in the competition when he played and scored against mauritius is uncertain whether he will take to the field or not,0.0,33.0
the chipolopolo fans however are not being so cautious with victory concert already scheduled for after the match featuring some of the country top musicians,0.0,25.0
both sides are hoping to win the competition for record third time and so keep the trophy for good,0.0,19.0
the chipolopolo won the first two editions of the regional tournament for southern african nations in 1997 and 1998,0.0,19.0
they were prevented from third straight win by angola who knocked out the zambians at the semi-final stage in 1999,1.0,20.0

this hasn happened in the spanish league and spain for many years said spanish federation press officer fernando garrido,1.0,19.0
so you english reporters should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this,0.0,16.0
and spanish daily abc accuses english reporters of launching witch-hunt against aragones,1.0,12.0
perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue the paper says,0.0,23.0
what the boy in the bernabeu did was odd rooney seemed intent to kick any spanish player who approached him,1.0,20.0

republic of ireland manager brian kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over croatia,1.0,25.0
robbie keane took his republic record to 24 with first-half goal which proved enough for victory,0.0,16.0
it is just shame we did not take them against such technically gifted team said kerr,1.0,16.0
but given the conditions and the standard of the croatian team we should be very happy with the win,0.0,19.0
the republic side kept clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since kerr succeeded mick mccarthy,0.0,25.0
kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory,0.0,9.0
it was brilliant goal fantastic skill by damien duff,1.0,9.0
robbie might have scuffed it little but it was good goal,1.0,11.0
matchwinner keane was another full of praise for duff role in the goal,1.0,13.0
it was great play from damien said the tottenham striker,1.0,10.0
always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of 10 duffer is going to get it in the box,0.0,23.0
playing three up was something different,1.0,6.0
brian kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young stephen elliott getting run-out,1.0,18.0
the conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future,0.0,15.0
it is nice to see young players coming through,0.0,9.0
man-of-the-match duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed chance to make it 2-0 midway through the second half,0.0,19.0
he opted to bring steve finnan cross down and shoot against the bar when close-range header looked the best option,0.0,20.0
would have headed that every time but completely lost it in the lights said the chelsea star,0.0,17.0
was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing,1.0,15.0
we have had good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers,0.0,12.0
hopefully that can continue in 2005,0.0,6.0
chelsea win at fulham confirming their position at the premiership summit proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season,0.0,28.0
they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match,0.0,24.0
all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all,0.0,22.0
one thing is certain they have put themselves in position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed,0.0,19.0
they beat very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won 4-1 at fulham which was great result given that they had been showing good form,0.0,33.0
as said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have manager who will make it whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now,1.0,37.0
mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players,1.0,23.0
no-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by mourinho,0.0,9.0
he is regarded as touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk,1.0,26.0
mourinho doesn simply talk good game he won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto,1.0,20.0
some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions,0.0,13.0
ve also found him to be very realistic whenever ve heard him,0.0,12.0
he spent lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked,0.0,26.0
the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension,0.0,20.0
in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games,1.0,16.0
you can not win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital,0.0,24.0
also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful,1.0,22.0
now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good,0.0,20.0
just wonder if they lack predator particularly with didier drogba injured,0.0,11.0
he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of safe bet for the title,1.0,33.0
chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league,1.0,13.0
felt they would never have better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season,0.0,23.0
it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelsea squad,0.0,25.0
have said believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and have seen nothing to make me change me mind,1.0,28.0
if anything what have seen has confirmed my early impressions,1.0,10.0
and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenal rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out 5-4 winners,0.0,20.0
mourinho had his say on that game complaining five-four is hockey score not football score,1.0,15.0
in three-against-three training match if the score reaches 5-4 send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly,0.0,23.0
so to get result like that in game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful,1.0,14.0
on more serious note it was game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal,1.0,17.0
much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenal defence,1.0,25.0
confidence is crucial factor in defending,0.0,6.0
when you start conceding goals you suddenly get chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area,0.0,21.0
you think oh no then find your worst fears confirmed,0.0,10.0
arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board,1.0,18.0
but the return of campbell is key,0.0,7.0
he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck,0.0,16.0
he is vastly experienced and has calming influence on all around him,0.0,12.0
campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as unit,1.0,15.0
chelsea have no such problems at present which is why would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season,1.0,25.0
hearts of oak set up an all ghanaian confederation cup final with 3-2 win over cameroon cotonsport garoua in accra on sunday,1.0,22.0

of south africa 3-2 in douala neither side could have qualified for the final,1.0,14.0
hearts of oak started the game needing win to qualify for the final while cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through,1.0,23.0
louis agyemang scored the first two goals for hearts either side of half time before ben don bortey scored the third,0.0,21.0
hearts looked set for comfortable win but cotonsport staged late fight back scoring twice late on,0.0,16.0
first of all boukar makaji scored in the 89th minute and then minutes into injury time at the end of the game andre nzame iii was on target,0.0,28.0
but it was too little too late for the cameroonians and hearts held on to win the game and place in the final,1.0,23.0

charlton manager alan curbishley paid tribute to two-goal striker jonatan johansson after beating norwich,0.0,14.0
curbishley said after the 4-0 win there was talk about norwich being interested in the summer but have lot of faith in jonatan,1.0,23.0
when there was talk of other clubs just told him he was going nowhere,1.0,14.0
he part of our squad and he got us couple of important goals early on,0.0,15.0
sure he happy here but was delighted with all the players,0.0,11.0
curbishley was subjected to criticism from charlton fans recently and he said the thing about this club is that we have got where we are by all pulling in the same direction,1.0,32.0
that happened for however long ve been here and we don want people taking sides,0.0,15.0
celtic neil lennon admits rangers could be considered slight favourites for the old firm cis cup clash but insists his side can still win,1.0,24.0
lennon concedes rangers are in good form at the moment but they have failed to beat celtic in their last seven meetings,1.0,22.0
rangers are on the up and have been on good run in recent weeks he said,1.0,16.0
but it game we believe we re capable of winning if we play our best he told the evening times,0.0,20.0
all the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in,0.0,17.0
without playing at the top of our game we have still been winning matches,1.0,14.0
at the minute we are at the top of the league and still in with chance of staying in europe so don think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out,0.0,34.0
of course it is concern when you are losing goals because we have been notorious for being team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets but hopefully we are over that wee run,0.0,35.0
considering we lost henrik larsson at the end of last season we have still been scoring lot of goals which is pleasing,0.0,22.0
middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with european football after the 2-0 uefa cup win against lazio,0.0,25.0
boro who are playing in europe for the first time in their 128-year history are top of group with maximum points,0.0,21.0
think we have taken to europe really well said mcclaren,1.0,10.0
we got about lazio didn let them settle or play,0.0,10.0
and in possession we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward,0.0,14.0
before the match mcclaren had said that win over the italian giants would put boro firmly on the european footballing map,1.0,21.0
and after they did just that he said it was perfect european night,1.0,13.0
for the team to give the fans performance like that was the icing on the cake,0.0,16.0
there have been many good performances but this was something special,1.0,11.0
you can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing,0.0,13.0
to win in europe you need to defend well and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games,0.0,24.0
we can also score goals and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had so we have good balance,1.0,24.0
mcclaren only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals,0.0,17.0
it should have been more convincing said mcclaren,1.0,8.0
but had watched lazio in recent weeks and saw them score late equaliser against inter milan on saturday so knew we needed second goal,0.0,24.0
no matter what anybody says lazio are favourites to win this competition,0.0,12.0
middlesbrough forward boudewijn zenden said he did not expect such comfortable match after he scored both goals,1.0,17.0
we didn expect it to be that one-sided said zenden,1.0,10.0
we did quite well in the first half we pressured them and they didn cope with that,0.0,17.0
think we played quite well and it was very good game especially in the first half,1.0,16.0
the holland international said boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games,0.0,19.0
we ve got very good feeling there is good spirit all the lads work hard for each other and it squad of friendly players which think you can see on the pitch he added,0.0,34.0
liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group,1.0,18.0
jorge andrade early own goal gave liverpool 1-0 win,0.0,9.0
and benitez said we started at very high tempo and had many chances,0.0,13.0
it is very important win for us and we could have scored more goals,1.0,14.0
we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack,0.0,12.0
we are pleased but move on to the next game,0.0,10.0
igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso and benitez said he played very well,1.0,18.0
it is important to have all the players ready and good squad so you can play more games at high level,1.0,21.0
benitez added it is all back in our own hands now it was great win for us and was delighted with what feel was the best liverpool have seen,1.0,29.0
as far as my feelings about winning in spain that is really not important,0.0,14.0
want to see us win away matches in the champions league that it was in spain was not my first consideration,1.0,21.0
as far as am concerned it is important for liverpool to win it is not important in what country it is in,1.0,22.0
benitez added benitez said we had problem before the start it was decided that xabi could not play more than 45 minutes,1.0,22.0
but in the end because of the way that dietmar hamann and igor biscan performed we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match,0.0,30.0
depor are good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed,0.0,18.0
but we knew that if we hit them on the counter-attack it would make them nervous and that is how it worked out,0.0,23.0
deportivo coach javier irureta said liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down,1.0,17.0
know we have now gone six games at home in europe without scoring but that does not reflect our overall performances,0.0,21.0
but this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination,0.0,12.0
the goal was bad mistake and big blow to our confidence,0.0,11.0
players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it,0.0,13.0
know we are bottom of the group but as long as there is hope of qualifying we will hang on to that,0.0,22.0

maybe when turn 60 and have been managing in the same league for 20 years and have the respect of everybody will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble little bit,0.0,35.0
the referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free-kicks,1.0,21.0
it was fault after fault dive after dive,0.0,8.0
but know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half-time,0.0,14.0
he should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him but there was also someone else,1.0,20.0
referees chief keith hackett believes mourinho should retract his comments about ferguson and barry as he believes the blues boss has questioned their integrity,1.0,24.0
hoping he might reconsider his comments unfortunately this is the nature of the game said hackett,0.0,16.0
don want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers,0.0,13.0
for the second leg we have an experienced referee and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing,1.0,24.0
sometimes managers have grounds for comments and note that but referees integrity has been questioned that is offensive and should be avoided,0.0,22.0
mr mourinho should look at the facts,0.0,7.0
mourinho added that the match was entertaining for goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final,1.0,19.0

we have exactly the same chance we had before this game,0.0,11.0
we are confident of getting result but we know what manchester united is footballing power,0.0,15.0
it ll be difficult for us but also for them,0.0,10.0

he ran at me with hands raised saying what do you want to do about it,0.0,16.0
to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable,0.0,14.0
it disgrace but don expect wenger to ever apologise he that type of person,1.0,14.0
those allegations were put to wenger after saturday game at bolton which arsenal lost to slip 10 points behind chelsea in the title race,1.0,24.0
at first he said only ve always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened,0.0,17.0
if he has to talk he talks,0.0,7.0
if he wants to make newspaper article he makes newspaper article,0.0,11.0
he doesn interest me and doesn matter to me at all,0.0,11.0
will never answer to any provocation from him any more,0.0,10.0

have no diplomatic relations with him the arsenal boss is quoted as saying,0.0,13.0
what don understand is that he does what he wants and you the press are all at his feet,0.0,19.0
the situation concerning the food fight has been judged and there is game going on in month,1.0,17.0
the managers have responsibility to protect the game before the game,1.0,11.0
but in england you are only punished for what you say after the game,1.0,14.0
now the whole story starts again,0.0,6.0
am football manager and love football above all no matter what people say,1.0,13.0

if we manage to get through it shows how well the club progressing,0.0,13.0
they have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on,0.0,20.0

there will be good atmosphere and the hearts fans have an important role to play,1.0,15.0
we need their encouragement we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible,0.0,22.0
hopefully the players will respond to that and know they will because it fantastic european night for the club,1.0,19.0
sol campbell proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn arsenal hard-fought win at portsmouth,1.0,15.0
the england defender lashed home 25-yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take arsenal back into second spot five points behind chelsea,1.0,25.0
but before campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to pompey striker ricardo fuller,1.0,17.0
in the first half he blasted wide when clear and his control let him down in the second half when well placed,0.0,22.0
portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny arsenal space in the early stages,0.0,16.0
but their marking was slack at corner and patrick vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him 16 yards out,0.0,23.0
mistake by arjan de zeeuw let thierry henry in behind the pompey defence on 17 minutes but as he bore down on goal linvoy primus got in saving tackle,0.0,29.0
with just fuller as an out-and-out striker portsmouth shape made life difficult for arsenal,0.0,14.0
but delightful touch by robin van persie gave henry sight of goal although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble jamie ashdown,1.0,25.0
ashdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at corner and kolo toure headed just wide and as arsenal began to press van persie blasted over good opportunity after henry had set him up,1.0,39.0
henry took quick return pass from vieira but ashdown was out quickly to block and there were some anxious seconds for pompey as the ball ran loose before matthew taylor cleared,1.0,31.0
after playing second fiddle portsmouth should have taken the lead on 34 minutes,0.0,13.0
referee howard webb played good advantage to allow steve stone to send gary neil away but having shrugged off toure the pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from 10 yards,1.0,30.0
as half-time approached henry teased shot through ruck of players and inches wide,1.0,13.0
at the other end fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as toure closed him down,0.0,18.0
fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when patrik berger break and slipped pass played him clear,1.0,24.0
but poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under vieira challenge referee webb was not interested,0.0,25.0
fuller paid the price when he gave way on 55 minutes to aiyegbeni yakubu who returned after six weeks out with knee injury,0.0,23.0
but it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from ashdown to cling on to van persie shot as henry sniffed for scraps,1.0,22.0
portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper manuel almunia had to stand his ground to beat away powerful shot from berger,0.0,21.0
arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of campbell,1.0,17.0
the england defender needed little invitation as pompey backed off to stride forward and lash ferocious shot past ashdown,0.0,19.0
arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when mathieu flamini escaped his marker to flash header wide from henry free-kick,0.0,22.0
almunia went full length to grab berger long-range shot while ashdown palmed away substitute dennis bergkamp shot,1.0,17.0

neil mellor gave liverpool the lead before half-time from milan baros pass before the czech added third after rounding shay given on the hour,1.0,24.0
newcastle then had lee bowyer sent off for two bookable offences,0.0,11.0
liverpool brought back luis garcia after hamstring injury while newcastle were forced to draft in kluivert after craig bellamy was late withdrawal with back injury sustained in the warm-up,1.0,29.0
and garcia should have crowned his return with goal inside the opening minute when he took pass from baros but shot wildly over the top from eight yards,0.0,28.0
olivier bernard was only inches away from giving newcastle the lead after 20 minutes when he fired just wide from free-kick 25 yards out,0.0,24.0
but souness side did go ahead 11 minutes later in highly controversial circumstances,0.0,13.0
kluivert looked suspiciously offside when kieron dyer set bowyer free but the dutchman was then perfectly placed to score from six yards,1.0,22.0
the lead lasted three minutes with liverpool back on terms as bramble headed gerrard corner into his own net under pressure from sami hyypia,0.0,24.0
and liverpool were ahead after 37 minutes when baros slid perfect pass into mellor path for the youngster to slip slide-rule finish into given bottom corner,1.0,26.0
garcia finishing was wayward and he was wasteful again in first-half injury time shooting tamely at given after good work by xabi alonso,0.0,23.0
any hopes of newcastle recovery looked to be snuffed out on the hour when brilliant turn and pass by harry kewell set baros free and he rounded given to score,1.0,30.0
jermaine jenas then missed glorious chance to throw newcastle lifeline shooting over from just eight yards out from shola ameobi cross,0.0,21.0
then bowyer who had already been booked for foul on alonso was deservedly shown the red card by referee graham poll for wild challenge on liverpool substitute florent sinama-pongolle,1.0,29.0

he added we have had to play two matches in three days which is foreign to many of my players and although understand the traditions of football here at this time of year it is not good for your health to do it,1.0,43.0
you can sit back and smoke cigars one after another and it is good life but it is not actually good for you,0.0,23.0
playing so many games is certainly not healthy especially for teams who still have european commitment,0.0,16.0
arsenal manager arsene wenger has admitted he is at loss to explain why newcastle are languishing in the bottom half of the table,0.0,23.0
the gunners travel to st james park on wednesday with newcastle 14th in the premiership after troubled season,0.0,18.0
and wenger said at the beginning of the season you would expect them to be fighting for the top four,1.0,20.0
don know how they got to be where they are,0.0,10.0
it looks to me from the outside that they have many injuries,0.0,12.0
arsenal go into the game on the back of 2-0 victory over fulham on sunday,1.0,15.0
and wenger added the best way to prepare for game is to win the previous one,1.0,16.0
we will go to newcastle in good shape,0.0,8.0
fatigue won play too big part in the next few weeks as we have players coming back so can rotate bit more,0.0,22.0
we do not play season with 11 players and believe that all of our squad deserve chance in the team,1.0,20.0
striker thierry henry along with robert pires scored against fulham,0.0,10.0
and henry afterwards described the display as beautiful to watch,0.0,10.0
he said what matters is winning and the three points of course,0.0,12.0
that is the only thing that really matters,0.0,8.0
but it is more enjoyable when you play like we did against fulham,1.0,13.0
we are playing as team and that is important because there were some games when we maybe were not there as team and suffered for that,1.0,26.0
manchester united alex ferguson has praised his players gutsy performance in the 1-0 win at aston villa,0.0,17.0
that was our hardest away game of the season and it was fantastic game of football end-to-end with lots of good passing said the old trafford boss,1.0,27.0
we showed lots of character and guts and we weren going to lose,0.0,13.0
look at that fixture and think we ve been there and won while arsenal and chelsea have yet to come and villa may have some players back when they do,0.0,30.0
ferguson also hailed senior stars ryan giggs and roy keane who came off the bench for the injured john shea,1.0,20.0
roy came on and brought bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got,1.0,21.0
giggs was tremendous threat and he brings tremendous penetration,1.0,9.0
all we can do is maintain our form play as we are and we ll get our rewards,0.0,18.0
spurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes shot clearly crossed the line but was not given,1.0,24.0
the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can we just stop the game and get the decision right said jol after the 0-0 draw,0.0,26.0
but at the end of the day it so obvious that pedro shot was over the line it incredible,1.0,19.0
we feel robbed but it difficult for the linesman and referee to see it,0.0,14.0
mendes shot from 50 yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear,0.0,21.0
jol added we are not talking about the ball being couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line it was metre inside the goal,1.0,27.0
what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005 watching something on tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn told about it,1.0,30.0
we didn play particularly well but am pleased even now with point although we should have had three,0.0,18.0
mendes could not believe the goal was not given after seeing replay,1.0,12.0
he said my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate,1.0,10.0
it was very nice goal it was clearly over the line ve never seen one so over the line and not given in my career,1.0,25.0
what can you do but laugh about it,0.0,8.0
it nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn count,0.0,15.0
it not every game you score from the halfway line,0.0,10.0
manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology,0.0,19.0
think it hammers home what lot of people have been asking for and that that technology should play part in the game ferguson told mutv,0.0,25.0
what was against originally was the time factor in video replays,1.0,11.0
but read an article the other day which suggested that if referee can make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching video replay then the game should carry on,1.0,30.0
thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise free-kick or take corner or goal-kick,0.0,19.0
so you wouldn be wasting lot of time,0.0,8.0
think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions,0.0,11.0
think that would be an opening into new area of football,0.0,11.0
arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology,0.0,15.0
when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be goal at old trafford that just reinforces what feel there should be video evidence said wenger,1.0,29.0
it great example of where the referee could have asked to see replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was goal,1.0,24.0
fly-half charlie hodgson admitted his wayward kicking played big part in england 18-17 defeat to france,1.0,16.0

very disappointed with the result and with my myself hodgson said,1.0,11.0
it is very hard to take but it something will have to get through and come back stronger,0.0,18.0
my training been good but it just didn happen,0.0,9.0
hodgson revealed that olly barkley had taken three penalties because they were out of my range but the centre could not convert his opportunities either particularly the drop goal late on,0.0,31.0
it wasn good strike he added,0.0,6.0
felt as soon as it hit my boot it had missed,0.0,11.0
it very disappointing but must recover,0.0,6.0
andy robinson said he would keep working on the kicking with his squad,1.0,13.0
however the england coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat,1.0,14.0
we went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have france done,1.0,16.0
they won the game from kicking penalties from our 10m line,1.0,11.0
the lads showed lot of ambition in the first half they went out to sustain it in the second but couldn build on it,1.0,24.0
we took the ball into contact and you know when you do that it is lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side,0.0,32.0
we have lost game we should have won,0.0,8.0
there is fine line between winning and losing and for the second week we ve been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts,0.0,26.0

we made lot of mistakes in the second half and they punished us,0.0,13.0
they took their chances when they came,0.0,7.0
last week we lost by two points now one point,0.0,10.0

bath prop matt stevens is the only remaining tight-head in england training squad and could be involved against ireland,1.0,19.0
but he has to play second fiddle at club level to duncan bell who excelled for england against france and may now be called into the squad,0.0,27.0
the extent of barkley injury is not yet clear but bath boss john connolly rates him no better than 50-50 to face ireland,0.0,23.0
barkley played at inside cente in england defeat by france and if he is unable to play england constantly-changing midfield will once again have to be altered,0.0,27.0
robinson could choose to recall mathew tait or henry paul although tait endured nightmare for newcastle against leicester on saturday and paul limped off with an ankle injury against bath,0.0,30.0
in-form leicester centre ollie smith is the other outstanding candidate and two tries against newcastle will have boosted his chances,0.0,20.0

kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try,1.0,32.0
think mark cueto scored perfectly legal try and think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson,1.0,22.0
it is how we use the technology,0.0,7.0
it is there and it should be used,0.0,8.0

wales hooker mefin davies is likely to stay with english side gloucester despite reported interest from the neath-swansea ospreys,1.0,19.0
bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old but that he would prefer to stay where he is,0.0,20.0
davies one of the stars of saturday rbs six nations win over england is only on year contract at kingsholm,0.0,20.0
but the hooker has proved his worth to the zurich premiership side and is likely to get new deal next season,0.0,21.0
the summer demise of the celtic warriors region left davies in the cold and forced him to take semi-professional contract with neath rfc,0.0,23.0
although he got match time with the ospreys at the request of the wales management he admitted before his move to gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated,1.0,32.0
the wru didn give me any help off the field it was very disappointing davies said at the time,1.0,19.0
it was hard time throughout the summer then deciding whether to accept an offer from stade francais which would have ended my wales career,1.0,24.0
the referee from saturday france scotland six nations match has defended the officials handling of the game after criticism by matt williams,1.0,22.0
the scotland coach said his side were robbed of victory by poor decisions made by the officials,1.0,17.0
but nigel williams said satisfied the game was handled correctly,0.0,10.0
meanwhile matt williams will not be punished by the scottish rugby union for allegedly using bad language in his comments about the officials,1.0,23.0
nonetheless he was furious about several decisions that he felt denied his side famous victory,0.0,15.0
but nigel williams told the scottish daily mail spoke to matt williams at the post-match dinner,1.0,16.0
he made no mention of the disallowed try or any other refereeing decisions whatsoever,0.0,14.0
if matt has issues with the match officials then he is very welcome to phone me and discuss them,1.0,19.0
ultimately there is match assessor at every international game to give an impartial and objective view of the performance of the officials,0.0,22.0
that is the beginning and end of it,0.0,8.0
england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales,1.0,28.0
robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates sunday set-to with france at twickenham,1.0,25.0
lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems,0.0,17.0
and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat,1.0,14.0
olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour,1.0,22.0
the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france with either tait or noon dropping out,1.0,16.0
tait given little opportunity to shine in attack received praise from robinson afterwards even if the coach admitted cardiff was an unforgiving place for the teenage prodigy,1.0,27.0
robinson now has tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line after just one outing player he regards as central to england future,0.0,25.0
tait himself at least outwardly appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular,0.0,20.0
want more of that definitely he said,0.0,7.0
hopefully can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see,0.0,25.0
we were playing on our own 22 for lot of the first half so it was quite difficult,0.0,18.0
thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france,0.0,16.0
his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test,1.0,14.0
he missed tackle on michael owen in the build-up to wales try conceded penalty at the breakdown was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson cross-kick into touch all inside the first quarter,0.0,35.0
his contribution improved in the second half but england clearly need more of playmaker in the inside centre role,0.0,19.0
up front the line-out remains fallible despite superb performance from chris jones whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody,0.0,25.0
it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards with andy hazell likely to make way,1.0,30.0
lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground,0.0,27.0
bath prop duncan bell has been added to england 30-man squad to face ireland in the rbs six nations,1.0,19.0
and with phil vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with broken arm and julian white out with neck injury bell could make his england debut,1.0,26.0
bell 30 had set his sights on an international career with wales,0.0,12.0
but last december the international rugby board confirmed that he could only be eligible for england as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998,0.0,26.0
england coach andy robinson could take gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row,1.0,19.0
but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and more likely scenario is for uncapped bell who was among the tryscorers when england beat france 30-20 nine days ago to be drafted in,0.0,34.0
robinson also has an injury worry over centre olly barkley who withdrew from bath starting line-up to face gloucester last weekend,1.0,21.0
he was due to have hospital scan on monday while gloucester centre henry paul who started at fly-half against bath limped out at kingsholm because of an ankle problem,1.0,29.0
despite barkley three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against france he is expected to retain his place at inside centre although leicester in-form prospect ollie smith would be an obvious replacement,0.0,32.0
bath coach john connolly rates barkley as no better than 50 50 chance to make the dublin trip,0.0,18.0
uncapped fly-half andy goode has been named in 30-man training squad for the ireland game and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during leicester record 83-10 win against newcastle on sunday,0.0,34.0
england players are due to meet at their surrey training base on monday,0.0,13.0
ireland coach eddie sullivan heaped praise on italy after seeing his side stutter to 28-17 victory in rome,1.0,18.0
it was hell of tough game said sullivan,1.0,8.0
we struggled in the first half because we hadn the football,1.0,11.0
they handled the ball well in terms of kicking it if that not an oxymoron,0.0,15.0
we said before the game that it might take until 10 minutes from the end for this game to be won and that how it turned out,0.0,27.0
ireland struggled to cope with italy fierce start and were indebted to skipper brian driscoll who set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer,0.0,25.0
we had our first attack in the italian half after 22 minutes said sullivan,1.0,14.0
we had good return with three first-half possessions in their half and we scored twice,0.0,15.0
the second half was about spending more time in their half,1.0,11.0
scrum-half peter stringer was also glad that ireland escaped wtih victory,0.0,11.0
all credit to them he told bbc sport,0.0,8.0
we knew it would be tough coming to rome,0.0,9.0
they always give us tough game here and they showed lot of spirit,0.0,13.0
they had lot of ball in the first half but we got few scores when we got into their 22,1.0,20.0
two moments of magic from brian driscoll guided ireland to workmanlike victory against italy,1.0,14.0
pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer,1.0,18.0
italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer try gave ireland lead they never lost,1.0,17.0
the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia but denis hickie try ensured an irish victory,0.0,25.0
italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes,0.0,18.0
it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with ronan gara penalty midway through the first half,1.0,28.0
the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and for the first quarter the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs,0.0,28.0
when they finally did just before the half-hour mark driscoll promptly created sparkling try for murphy,1.0,16.0
the ireland captain ran dummy scissors and made magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner,0.0,24.0
gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again,0.0,13.0
roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera and he landed penalty either side of the break to edge italy into 9-8 lead,1.0,29.0
the only ireland player offering real threat was driscoll and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors,1.0,23.0
shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over with gara landing the tricky conversion,0.0,25.0
penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter but they were lucky to survive when italy launched series of attacks,1.0,25.0
winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from driving maul,0.0,19.0
an gara penalty put ireland more than converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for converted try,1.0,30.0
driscoll limped off late on joining centre partner gordon arcy on the sidelines and the final word went to italy,0.0,20.0
prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish under pressure throughout,0.0,23.0

wales fly-half stephen jones admitted he was happy to hand gavin henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against england,1.0,20.0
jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales 9-8 down were awarded long-range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff,1.0,22.0
knew the percentages of gavin reaching it were far higher than me jones said,1.0,14.0
when he said he wanted it there were no problems,0.0,10.0
jones had seen long-range effort fall whisker under the crossbar on the hour before charlie hodgson put england in front with 10 minutes left,0.0,24.0
looked at where it was and knew was going to struggle to make it jones added,1.0,16.0
said to gareth thomas the wales captain this is touch and go,1.0,12.0
it was out of my range and obviously gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance,0.0,16.0
he was confident and fancied it,1.0,6.0
there were no questions that he miss it the way he was playing,0.0,13.0
jones was happy to hail henson heroic contribution to wales first win over england in cardiff since 1993,1.0,18.0
physically he specimen he balanced player he glides when he runs and obviously he got great kicking game as well jones said,1.0,22.0
his defence was superb he made some great hits and he had great game,1.0,14.0
victory over england for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what wales might achieve in this year six nations,0.0,24.0
but they now face three away fixtures in italy france and scotland before completing their campaign against ireland in cardiff,0.0,20.0
people all over the world want to see wales back at the top table of world rugby said proud coach mike ruddock,0.0,22.0
but we are not there yet,0.0,6.0
the next step is finding the consistency to get further wins,0.0,11.0
we have to travel this week and we can afford to get too giddy about this result,0.0,17.0
we have got to be professional and keep focused on facing italy,0.0,12.0
none more so than henson who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of jonny wilkinson and brian driscoll,0.0,28.0
the confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however,0.0,15.0
the sort of player who likes pressure on me he said,1.0,11.0
it makes me more concentrated and think perform better under more pressure,0.0,12.0
set high standard against england and ve got to back it up next week,1.0,14.0
two years ago when we played italy wasn involved and we lost so we ve got to put that right next week,1.0,22.0
wales centre sonny parker and number eight ryan jones will miss saturday game with italy because of injury,1.0,18.0
parker has not recovered from trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over england and tom shanklin is expected to continue at centre,1.0,28.0
jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as replacement against england and joins flanker colin charvis foot injury on the sidelines,0.0,22.0
meanwhile mike ruddock may make gavin henson his first-choice kicker in rome,1.0,12.0
the centre was wales hero in the 11-9 six nations win over england landing huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game,1.0,24.0
first-choice kicker stephen jones handed over responsibility because of henson greater kicking range but the fly-half had already missed number of shots at goal,0.0,24.0
our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team but giving him the kicks is something we ll talk about in selection this week wales coach mike ruddock told bbc sport wales,1.0,34.0
henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last saturday game,0.0,20.0
thrive on it and think it makes me perform better he said,0.0,12.0
glad it short week before the italy game,0.0,8.0
there was so much build-up before england but we fly out to rome on thursday and we ll be back playing again,0.0,22.0
italy coach john kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing ireland close when they meet wales on saturday,1.0,24.0
despite losing 28-17 in sunday six nations encounter the italians confirmed their continuing improvement,0.0,14.0
our goal is to match every side we face and against ireland we showed we could do that said kirwan,1.0,20.0
but the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play wales on saturday,0.0,18.0
italy half-backs had mixed afternoon with recalled scrum-half alessandro troncon impressing but fly-half luciano orquera having an off-day with the boot,0.0,21.0
kirwan said was very happy with troncon,1.0,7.0
he had an incredible game he was very good in attack and defence,1.0,13.0
orquera kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence,0.0,11.0
he also followed the game plan,0.0,6.0
we have to give him confidence because he has the capability to do well,0.0,14.0
france have brought flanker serge betsen back into their squad to face england at twickenham on sunday,1.0,17.0
but the player who missed the victory over scotland through injury must attend disciplinary hearing on wednesday after being cited by wasps,1.0,22.0
serge has good case so we are confident he will play said france coach bernard laporte,1.0,16.0
the inexperienced nicolas mas jimmy marlu and jean-philippe grandclaude are also included in 22-man squad,0.0,15.0
the trio have been called up after pieter de villiers ludovic valbon and aurelien rougerie all picked up injuries in france 16-9 win on saturday,0.0,25.0
laporte said he was confident that betsen would be cleared by the panel investigating his alleged trip that broke wasps centre stuart abbott leg,1.0,24.0
if he was to be suspended we would call up imanol harinordoquy or thomas lievremont said laporte who has dropped patrick tabacco,1.0,22.0
we missed serge badly against scotland,0.0,6.0
he has now recovered from his thigh injury and played on saturday with biarritz,0.0,14.0
france regular back-row combination of betsen harinordoquy and olivier magne were all missing from france side at the weekend because of injury,1.0,22.0

wales coach mike ruddock says england lock danny grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked dwayne peel,1.0,19.0
trouble flared at ruck in the first half of wales 11-9 win in cardiff as grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot leaving peel bloodied,0.0,27.0
grewcock was sin-binned with wales captain gareth thomas for retaliation,1.0,10.0
it up to the citing commissioner said ruddock,1.0,8.0
not saying it deliberate but grewcock did similar thing for bath against leinster,0.0,13.0
last june grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of boot in match against new zealand,1.0,20.0
six years earlier also in new zealand grewcock became only the second england player to be sent off in tests,0.0,20.0
the player himself and his captain jason robinson have both said that the clash with peel was accidental,1.0,18.0
if the ball is at the back of the ruck and feel can step over and disrupt it then will do that said grewcock,1.0,24.0
but ruddock feels that the england man should be more careful,0.0,11.0
the boy himself should look at his actions it was clumsy piece of footwork he said,0.0,16.0
he great player and don want to knock him we won be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident,0.0,21.0
not going to go too far with the lad,0.0,9.0
it could just be clumsy action and dwayne had just minor cut,0.0,12.0
the referee interpretation was that grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck,1.0,13.0
ruddock also warned his rbs nations championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements,0.0,15.0
we created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually said the coach,0.0,19.0
we ve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely lot of chances that we wasted,0.0,19.0
in the forthcoming games ruddock may use penalty hero gavin henson as his first-choice kicker in place of stephen jones,0.0,20.0
our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team but it something we ll talk about in selection this week said ruddock,1.0,24.0
the six nations may be glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer,1.0,33.0
the player who staked the biggest claim for place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson,1.0,19.0
you just had to listen to his interview afterwards he beamed with confidence but although there an element of arrogance it good arrogance,0.0,23.0
he certainly showed some nice touches,0.0,6.0
he once showed clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand,1.0,29.0
and that without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty,0.0,9.0
but think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test,0.0,19.0
he needs to come up against brian driscoll or big french midfield,0.0,12.0
wales fly-half stephen jones was another player who impressed me,1.0,10.0
he gave good direction he was very confident and he was nice general for his side,1.0,16.0
he showed he can control game,1.0,6.0
with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and jones or maybe even henson could make the lions team at fly-half,1.0,33.0
jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday game,1.0,17.0
some of the wales forwards surprised me because thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five,0.0,17.0
england prop julian white is capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top,0.0,30.0
however still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame,0.0,12.0
some english players did their cause no harm,0.0,8.0
thought joe worsley had solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong,0.0,16.0
but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and think it will be while before we see him again,0.0,20.0
despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france,0.0,12.0
tom smith has been there and done it before but the likes of chris cusiter jason white and ally hogg all made their mark,0.0,24.0
hogg made couple of good runs while white had pretty robust game his defence is right up there,1.0,18.0
cusiter looked very lively and he could be very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward,1.0,17.0
the star of ireland win over italy in rome looks like certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand,0.0,20.0
he ran some good lines against italy made the breaks and fed his outside backs although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him,1.0,27.0
gordon arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but think you could get henson arcy driscoll combination in the lions midfield,1.0,23.0
paul connell just needs to add hard edge to his game and malcolm kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up while shane byrne seems to be lively character,0.0,33.0
but they will be bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday although used to play in italy and know how difficult it can be,0.0,31.0
one player who didn impress me was wales scrum-half dwayne peel,1.0,11.0
he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing,0.0,12.0
they had good possession and he kicked the ball away wouldn want him as my lions scrum-half after that,1.0,19.0
it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory,1.0,19.0
their organisation was very very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by,1.0,22.0
it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced,0.0,12.0
we knew all along that we would be huge threat particularly the first game in the championship,0.0,17.0
it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early,1.0,17.0
we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually,0.0,14.0
it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it,1.0,19.0
not too bad but there are one or two others who will be feeling it bit on monday morning,0.0,19.0
in the backs we were not frustrated at such but the new rucking laws were little bit problematical,0.0,18.0
the different interpretations between the referee and the players was little difficult,1.0,12.0
but we managed to get the ball in our hands and got try near the end of the first half,0.0,20.0
it was great work by brian and always knew had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee,1.0,20.0
eddie sullivan was very calm at half-time even though we were only 8-6 ahead,1.0,14.0
he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory,0.0,18.0
that new ruck law made it bit more difficult to get out of our own half,1.0,16.0
we were penalised lot at the breakdown and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break,0.0,25.0
so really we went back to playing territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball,1.0,19.0
every one was little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon,1.0,15.0
as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries but it does not that good,0.0,18.0
now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover,0.0,13.0
it big ask after such bruising encounter,0.0,7.0
was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday,1.0,13.0
it could so easily have gone their way but for couple of decisions,0.0,13.0
we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us,0.0,14.0
in the meantime when in rome,0.0,6.0
wales make two changes for france,0.0,6.0
wales coach mike ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat italy 38-8 for saturday trip to france,1.0,20.0
kevin morgan takes over from his injured newport-gwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing,0.0,16.0
and in the pack neath-swansea ospreys forward ryan jones is preferred at blindside flanker to jonathan thomas,1.0,17.0
thomas try-scorer in rome drops down to the bench instead of ian gough while cardiff back rhys williams steps up in place of morgan,1.0,24.0
luscombe is sidelined by hamstring problem sustained during the six nations game against italy last weekend,1.0,16.0
however the experienced and in-form morgan was already pushing hard for start at stade de france,0.0,16.0
due to his impressive performances from the bench kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway and the unfortunate injury to hal gives him the chance to start said ruddock,1.0,31.0
now that ryan jones has recovered from injury we have increased the options in the back row,0.0,17.0
jonathan thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against italy and scoring try but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail,0.0,30.0
for this particular game we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against italy so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion,0.0,40.0
obviously it 22-man game these days and there is every chance that jonathan will be making an impact from the bench,0.0,21.0
wales have beaten france on two of their last three visits to paris and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for first five or six nations title triumph since 1994,0.0,35.0
graham henry former wales coach said couple of years ago that we should be bold when going to france and he was proved right said ruddock,0.0,26.0
that is great way to approach the game and something we will further endorse with the players this week,0.0,19.0

ireland maintained their six nations grand slam ambitions with an impressive victory over scotland at murrayfield,1.0,16.0
hugo southwell try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm kelly and paul connell put the visitors in command by half-time,0.0,26.0

powerful charge from flanker jason white was carried on by ali hogg and when ireland conceded penalty close to their own line scotland kicked it to touch,1.0,27.0
the irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion but stray hand in ruck allowed paterson to stroke over penalty in the eighth minute,0.0,25.0
if that was paltry reward for their early pressure scotland got the try they deserved when paterson searing break and andy craig pass sent southwell streaking to the right corner,1.0,30.0
paterson was off target with the conversion and fly-half dan parks then missed presentable drop-goal attempt,0.0,16.0
ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead,1.0,19.0
stuart grimes pulled down kelly at line-out ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set-piece the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack,1.0,29.0

connell skipper in the absence of brian driscoll powered through parks weak tackle after free-kick from scrummage to burrow over,0.0,20.0

fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year tournament,1.0,16.0
starting full of confidence after their victory over england the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes,0.0,19.0
diminutive wing shane williams fielded kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half,0.0,21.0
his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short the ball was switched left and michael owen long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in,0.0,33.0
stephen jones who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson heroics against england slotted an excellent conversion from wide out,0.0,20.0
wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute,1.0,24.0
henson sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england beat two players with ease out on the left touchline,0.0,23.0
but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner,0.0,26.0
with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum the home side forward power brought them back into it,0.0,22.0
but clever high kick from henson almost brought try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch,1.0,30.0
wales regained control with second try in the 21st minute henson lobbing up high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his 15th test try,1.0,32.0
jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with penalty attempt for italy,1.0,17.0
henson was also narrowly short with long-range effort at goal but wales ended the half with vital third score to give themselves some breathing space,0.0,25.0
henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post jones adding the conversion,1.0,31.0
italy who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with head knock before half-time built up head of steam on the resumption,0.0,19.0
de marigny landed penalty to make it 19-8 and nitoglia break through the middle threatened try only for the move to break down with knock-on,0.0,25.0
but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour,1.0,17.0
their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams who beat several players with ease and finished with powerful angled run from lock cockbain,1.0,29.0
before italy could recover from that blow strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over,1.0,27.0
with jones converting both for 33-8 lead wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter,0.0,21.0
the icing on the cake came with sixth try after more superb support work shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner,1.0,28.0
the only downside for wales was hamstring injury suffered by luscombe,1.0,11.0
but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years they will travel to paris in fortnight looking like genuine contenders,0.0,28.0

the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia but denis hickie try ensured an irish victory,0.0,25.0
italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes,0.0,18.0
it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with ronan gara penalty midway through the first half,1.0,28.0
the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and for the first quarter the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs,0.0,28.0
when they finally did just before the half-hour mark driscoll promptly created sparkling try for murphy,1.0,16.0
the ireland captain ran dummy scissors and made magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner,0.0,24.0
gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again,0.0,13.0
roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera and he landed penalty either side of the break to edge italy into 9-8 lead,1.0,29.0
the only ireland player offering real threat was driscoll and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors,1.0,23.0

driscoll limped off late on joining centre partner gordon arcy on the sidelines and the final word went to italy,0.0,20.0

and it the same again in getting into the senior squad,0.0,11.0
but now that have this opportunity intend to take it fully if selected and play my heart out for my country,0.0,21.0
england coach andy robinson could take gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row,1.0,19.0

england captain jason robinson has rubbished suggestions that the world champions are team in decline,1.0,15.0
england were beaten 11-9 by wales in their six nations opener in cardiff last week and face current champions france at twickenham on sunday,1.0,24.0
robinson said we are certainly not on the decline,1.0,9.0
you lose one game and it doesn make you bad team,0.0,11.0
have no doubt in the players we ve got,0.0,9.0
we have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day,1.0,15.0
england find themselves striving to avoid third successive championship defeat for the first time since 1987,0.0,16.0
but full-back robinson believes the new-look england team can stop the rot against france,1.0,14.0
last weekend we should have won the game he said,0.0,10.0
but if we can under-perform and lose by only two points then am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need,1.0,27.0
we proved that in the autumn when we put in some excellent performances and we just need to build on that,0.0,21.0
it was disappointing start against wales and we might be down on that,0.0,13.0
but we are certainly not out,0.0,6.0
we will come out fighting this week,0.0,7.0
robinson also had words of comfort for 18-year-old newcastle centre mathew tait who made his international debut against wales but has been demoted from the squad to face france,1.0,29.0
have had word with mathew said robinson,1.0,7.0
he is an outstanding player but we have gone for olly barkley because of the kicking,0.0,16.0
mathew has just got to take it on the chin keep working hard like he is doing and sure he will feature in some of the games,0.0,27.0
former france centre philippe sella believes coach bernard laporte must recall frederic michalak to give his side any chance of beating ireland,1.0,22.0
sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half yann delaigue in the rbs six nations to date,1.0,18.0
but he told bbc sport michalak is the answer both now and for the future,0.0,15.0
delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back michalak,1.0,13.0
he does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset ireland,1.0,12.0
the 22-year-old michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after delaigue impressed for castres early in the season,1.0,21.0
with michalak overlooked the french stuttered to narrow wins over scotland and then england before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to wales,0.0,25.0
the wales game was amazing to watch but never did think the french could lose that game at half-time said sella,1.0,21.0
their only mistakes were that they didn score enough points in the first half and were little bit less focused in the second but only little bit,0.0,27.0
sella however insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire laporte despite the defeat at the stade de france,0.0,19.0
this season is very important for shaping team for the 2007 world cup said sella which laporte is doing very well,1.0,21.0
the french get better every game,0.0,6.0
it difficult though when you change team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel,0.0,17.0
but he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to world cup victory,0.0,18.0
as result it is important that people give him time,0.0,10.0
it may not seem good now that we re not winning the grand slam but no one will care in two years time if we re world champions,0.0,28.0
the majority of media criticism centred on the way in which france produced performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games,0.0,23.0
but while sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against wales he said the win was most important,1.0,20.0
winning is all that matters he added,0.0,7.0
ok the flair may not have been so good but the discipline organisation and defence was there which are all important ahead of 2007,0.0,24.0
france play what sella believes is their hardest game of the six nations against ireland in dublin on saturday 12 march,1.0,21.0
the french go into the game as clear underdogs,0.0,9.0
but sella added people forget that france can still win the six nations and they ll be focused on that,1.0,20.0
but ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd,0.0,14.0

former australian wing david campese has told england to stop whingeing in the wake of their defeat to ireland,1.0,19.0
england coach andy robinson lambasted referee jonathan kaplan for costing them the game after disallowing tries from mark cueto and josh lewsey,1.0,22.0
but campese told bbc sport robinson is living up to england reputation as whingeing poms,1.0,15.0
stop going on about it as who really cares,0.0,9.0
they re acting like they re the first team to be cheated of win,0.0,14.0
england are contemplating complaint to the international rugby board after potential tries by cueto in the first half and lewsey late on were ruled out without recourse to the video referee,0.0,31.0
but campese added scotland could have beaten france in the same way but do you see them whingeing,1.0,18.0
basically things didn go england way and in typical fashion they make more of it when they believe they ve lost unfairly,0.0,22.0
england are second bottom in the six nations table following defeats by wales france and ireland,1.0,16.0
but although campese admitted he was surprised about their current predicament he insisted england were no longer world class,1.0,19.0
england are beginning to realise that being world champions doesn mean you deserve to win every game he said,1.0,19.0
they lost few key players and suddenly everyone realised the ones on the fringes were not all that good in the first place,0.0,23.0
added to that the senior players aren standing up and they can do anything when the pressure mounts,0.0,18.0
campese veteran of 101 international caps said full-back jason robinson would now be the sole englishman in his world xv,1.0,20.0
robinson has been blamed for poor leadership in the tournament while his coach has been castigated for appointing full-back captain,1.0,20.0
agree that you can captain from full-back said campese,1.0,9.0
you need someone in the thick of the action and it very hard to give orders from all the way back there,0.0,22.0
some people are leaders and some aren,0.0,7.0
he not but there no one who stands out in england pack no clear-cut leaders,0.0,15.0
campese though defended coach andy robinson who he believes was the only choice after sir clive woodward resignation,0.0,18.0
but he blamed lack of talent in the england camp for making the current coach look poor,0.0,17.0
england face potential wooden spoon match against italy on 12 march,0.0,11.0
and the ex-wallaby added if england lost that they be in bloody turmoil,1.0,13.0
that said don think they will,0.0,6.0
campese has tipped wales to win both the six nations and grand slam come the end of the tournament,1.0,19.0
it been surprising tournament he said and maybe ireland have little bit more talent overall,0.0,15.0
but playing at home is major boost,0.0,7.0

the north side have been hit by the withdrawals of scotland duo gordon bulloch and chris cusiter plus france captain fabien pelous,1.0,22.0
but leicester england centre ollie smith has been added to the squad giving him an opportunity to impress lions coach sir clive woodward who takes charge of the north side,1.0,30.0
think it fantastic for ollie tigers coach john wells told bbc radio leicester,0.0,13.0
he was probably going to have the weekend off this week and hope clive gets the chance to see the qualities that leicester and england have been seeing all year,0.0,30.0
woodward will also assess other potential lions candidates such as scotland pair simon taylor and chris paterson wales scrum-half dwayne peel and ireland lock paul connell,1.0,26.0

both teams are fielding top-quality sides and really hope that the rugby public and community get behind this game to raise as much money as possible for such deserving cause,1.0,30.0
despite the withdrawal of wales wing rhys williams who is required for the blues celtic league match with munster three other members of their six nations squad ceri sweeney john yapp and jonathan thomas will also play,0.0,37.0

italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday six nations contest against scotland will be scrappy encounter,1.0,15.0
with both sides looking for their first win of the championship the third-round game at murrayfield has been billed as wooden-spoon decider,1.0,22.0
and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being bruising battle of the packs,0.0,15.0
it will not be pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win said the lock forward,1.0,20.0
italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in 2000 but two of those have come against scotland,1.0,22.0
this year italy opened up with stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing 28-17,0.0,15.0
however they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out,0.0,15.0
now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations,1.0,17.0
scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh said bortolami,0.0,19.0
we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs,0.0,22.0
as nation our quest is to be respected as team worthy of place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games,0.0,25.0
england forward martin corry says jason robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways,1.0,20.0
after losses to wales and france critics have started to wonder whether robinson can captain from full-back,0.0,17.0
but corry has backed robinson who was given the role after the injury to fly-half jonny wilkinson ahead of this weekend trip to ireland,1.0,24.0
every week my respect for him goes up corry told bbc radio five live,1.0,14.0
when he talks with the squad he talks with lot of sense,0.0,12.0
the players have lot of respect for him,0.0,8.0
it an honour to be in the england side and an honour to play under him,1.0,16.0
england are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their six nations campaign,1.0,25.0
but corry insists england are in the right frame of mind for the contest,1.0,14.0
there is apprehension going into every game he added,0.0,9.0
but you have to use that fear and put it into positive mindset,0.0,13.0
when the whistle goes on sunday what has happened in the past does not count for anything,0.0,17.0
we have not performed but if we put in performance on sunday then we can start turning results around,1.0,19.0
there are lot of changes taking place with england and we are at the start of something,1.0,17.0
we have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good,0.0,25.0
trip to lansdowne road is daunting at any time especially against an ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins,0.0,22.0
they are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first grand slam since 1948,0.0,19.0
but corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the irish in their own backyard,0.0,15.0
they are full of confidence and are playing great team game he said,1.0,13.0
the forwards are creating great platform and they have explosive runners out wide,0.0,13.0
if you look at the team on paper they have stars from one to 15,0.0,15.0
it huge task but it is great opportunity for us,0.0,10.0
lansdowne road is tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage,1.0,17.0
prop jones ready for hard graft,0.0,6.0
adam jones says the wales forwards are determined to set the perfect attacking platform for the backs by dominating the powerful france pack in paris,1.0,25.0
the prop said if we get stuffed in the front five our backs have had it,0.0,16.0
the mentality of the french is scrum scrum scrum,0.0,9.0
we will see how good france are and the scrum is the key,1.0,13.0
just hope the backs carry on where they left off against italy,0.0,12.0
it just up to us in the forwards to win the ball and give them the opportunity,0.0,17.0
wales have won two of their last three visits to stade de france having secured back-to-back wins under graham henry in 1999 and 2001,0.0,24.0
and with the likes of shane williams and gavin henson finding top form at the right time mike ruddock team is now one of international rugby most potent attacking threats,0.0,30.0
he has been bouncing around the place this week so he is up for it warned jones,0.0,17.0
france have been criticised for their uncharacteristic one-dimensional play in their victories over scotland and france,1.0,16.0
captain fabien pelous has acknowledged his side needs to show more attacking flair but stressed the game with be won or lost up front,0.0,24.0
the lock believes the welsh forwards are not big enough to trouble his side in the scrum or line-out but jones insisted his fellow front-row colleagues have nothing to fear,1.0,30.0
gethin jenkins won be intimidated tomorrow none of us will said jones who will be facing france for the first time,1.0,21.0
we will go out there and front up and hopefully get the ball out to the backs,1.0,17.0
me and gethin are quite young so it is good to have someone of mefin experience in there,1.0,18.0
mefin is good thinker who puts things across,0.0,8.0
if you are good enough you are old enough and gethin certainly is,1.0,13.0

lewis moody has flown to dublin to join england camp ahead of their rbs six nations game against ireland on sunday,1.0,21.0
despite joining the squad the leicester flanker only has slim chance of playing because of an infection in his finger,1.0,20.0
decision will be taken on saturday as to whether the 26-year-old will be declared fit,0.0,15.0
if he fails to recover in time for the game his place at the back of the pack will be taken by andy hazell,1.0,24.0
chris jones will then start the game on the bench,1.0,10.0
the chances of him playing are very slim said coach andy robinson,1.0,12.0
the infection is deeper than was thought,0.0,7.0
moody had to be put on drip in an attempt to force antibiotics through his infected finger,0.0,17.0
he suffered the cut playing against france at twickenham and it became infected during 10-minute outing as replacement for leicester against newcastle last saturday,0.0,24.0
the mud got into it robinson added,0.0,7.0
he has had big course of antibiotics but they haven done the job we hoped they would,0.0,17.0
robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting line-up with bath prop matt stevens coming in for the injured phil vickery,1.0,25.0
the 22-year-old has only made 10 starts for his club but has made 49 appearances from the bench,1.0,18.0
it can be frustrating but ve had lot more game time this season and ready for it stevens said,1.0,19.0

robinson has confirmed that fly-half charlie hodgson will be the first-choice kicker despite his three missed penalties and drop goal against france,1.0,22.0
charlie state of mind is very good said robinson,0.0,9.0
obviously we are all disappointed we lost the french game and the circumstances in which we did,0.0,17.0
but he responded well last week in his goalkicking for sale and he will be our first-choice kicker this week,0.0,20.0
robinson also admits his side must improve their line-out work against irish duo malcolm kelly and paul connell one of the most effective partnerships in the game,0.0,27.0
in each game we ve missed number of line-outs he added,1.0,11.0
it cost us the game against wales but it has improved,1.0,11.0
it was better against france and will have to go up another notch against ireland,0.0,15.0

former france fly-half thomas castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach bernard laporte following their defeat by wales,1.0,20.0
france suffered shock loss against the welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win,1.0,18.0
castaignede told bbc sport the pressure is big on laporte after huge loss to new zealand slim win over scotland and miracle against england,1.0,24.0
but the french have to get behind him and the team at lansdowne road,0.0,14.0
following victories over south africa and australia in november france were deemed by many to be the world leading side,0.0,20.0
but they were then trounced 45-6 by new zealand and only just beat scotland after the scots had try disallowed in their six nations opener,0.0,25.0
it then took some woeful spot kicking from charlie hodgson and olly barkley to help them to victory against england at twickenham,0.0,22.0
castaignede said you can say any of those results have eased the pressure on laporte,1.0,15.0
had england kickers not been so bad the position in the six nations would be very different now,0.0,18.0
laporte has been criticised for france negative tactics in their wins over scotland and england,1.0,15.0
but his side played more free-flowing style against wales making mockery of the opposition defence in the first half before suffering shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval,0.0,28.0
all the chat in france has been about how france will play against ireland said castaignede ahead of the 12 march tie,1.0,22.0
everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against wales,1.0,12.0
castaignede veteran of 43 international caps admitted the french would go in as underdogs against ireland,1.0,16.0
going to ireland is never easy but the way they re playing right now it harder than ever said castaignede,1.0,20.0
they re very experienced and don often lose at home,0.0,10.0
they ve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break,0.0,13.0
despite praising the irish he claimed the welsh had the upper hand in the six nations run-in,0.0,17.0
ireland have such good pack but wales are something else on the break he added,0.0,15.0
at the weekend they were simply awesome,0.0,7.0
as frenchman it was disappointing to see but you had to admire it,0.0,13.0
their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship,0.0,11.0
the 30-year-old also tipped yann delaigue to start ahead of frederic michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in paris last weekend,0.0,23.0
delaigue played really well and admittedly michalak played well too said castaignede,1.0,12.0
just glad not the one who has to make the decision,0.0,11.0
charvis set to lose fitness bid,0.0,6.0
flanker colin charvis is unlikely to play any part in wales final two games of the six nations,1.0,18.0
charvis has missed all three of wales victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected,1.0,20.0
he will not figure in the scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game said wales physio mark davies,1.0,25.0
sonny parker is continuing to struggle with neck injury but hal luscombe should be fit for the murrayfield trip,0.0,19.0
centre parker has only slim chance of being involved against the scots on 13 march so luscombe return to fitness after missing the france match with hamstring trouble is timely boost,0.0,31.0
said wales assistant coach scott johnson we re positive about hal and hope he ll be raring to go,1.0,19.0
he comes back into the mix again adds to the depth and gives us other options,0.0,16.0
replacement hooker robin mcbryde remains doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in paris last saturday,1.0,16.0

england captain jason robinson will miss the rest of the six nations because of injury,1.0,15.0
robinson stand-in captain in the absence of jonny wilkinson had been due to lead england in their final two games against italy and scotland,1.0,24.0
but the sale full-back pulled out of the squad on wednesday because of torn ligament in his right thumb,0.0,19.0
the 30-year-old will undergo an operation on friday but england have yet to name replacement skipper,0.0,16.0
robinson said this is very disappointing for me as this means miss england last two games in the six nations at twickenham and two games for my club sale sharks,1.0,30.0
but looking to be back playing very early in april,0.0,10.0
robinson picked up the injury in the 19-13 defeat to ireland at lansdowne road on saturday,0.0,16.0

as england captain he has been an immense figure during the autumn internationals and the six nations leading by example at all times,1.0,23.0
look forward to having him back in the england squad,1.0,10.0
the announcement is the latest setback for robinson injury-depleted squad,0.0,10.0
among the key figures already missing are jonny wilkinson mike tindall will greenwood julian white and phil vickery list which leaves robinson short on candidates for the now vacant captaincy role,0.0,31.0
former england skipper jeremy guscott told bbc radio five live his choice would be matt dawson even though he is does not hold regular starting place,1.0,26.0
the obvious choice is dawson said guscott,0.0,7.0
especially given that harry ellis did not have his best game at scrum-half on saturday,0.0,15.0
dawson has the credentials and the experience even though his winning record at captain is not great,0.0,17.0
the other option in martin corry who is the standout forward at the moment,0.0,14.0
unfortunately england can not rely on leaders on the field at the moment,1.0,13.0

the england coach went on to claim that only one side was refereed,1.0,13.0

instead the rfu said in statement they would set out any concerns the england team management may have in confidential manner,1.0,21.0
an irb spokesman said on the matter we take all breaches of the code very seriously,0.0,16.0
should the rfu resolve the issue to our satisfaction as happened last month when the scotland coach matt williams apologised for remarks made it would be the end of the matter,0.0,31.0
kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in england 19-13 defeat at landsdowne road and admitted he was very disappointed with robinson remarks,0.0,22.0
and the south african has been appointed to take charge of scotland match against wales on 13 march,0.0,18.0

france coach bernard laporte said harinordoquy had been axed after poor display last weekend,0.0,14.0
imanol has been dropped from the squad because the least can say is that he didn make thundering comeback against wales said laporte,1.0,23.0
we know the ireland game will be fast and rough and we also want to be able to replace both locks during the game if needed and gregory lamboley can also come on at number seven or eight,0.0,38.0

it will be very exciting game because ireland have three wins under their belt have just defeated england and have their eyes set on grand slam,1.0,26.0

england world cup-winning fly-half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship,1.0,25.0
but rob andrew coach of wilkinson club side newcastle said that with only two games left to play wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time,1.0,26.0
it would be irresponsible to put him straight into test match andrew told the times,0.0,15.0
wilkinson is recovering from knee injury which followed long-term neck and arm injuries,0.0,13.0
he has not played for england since the world cup final in november 2003 since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their 14 matches,0.0,27.0
wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the zurich premiership match against harlequins on 13 march,1.0,21.0
that game is the day after england play italy in the six nations and six days before their final match of the championship against scotland,1.0,25.0
we are hoping jonny will be ready in fortnight but it is touch and go said andrew,0.0,17.0
his recovery is going very well and the key now is how he is reintroduced to playing and with it goal-kicking,0.0,21.0
he will probably have to come off the bench to start and it would be ridiculous and irresponsible to put him straight back into test match,0.0,26.0
we can afford to get it wrong with knee injury,0.0,10.0
we are in touch with england and they are relaxed about it,0.0,12.0
despite not playing for england wilkinson is still hoping to make the lions tour to new zealand this summer,1.0,19.0

want to speak to the irb about it,0.0,8.0
think only one side was refereed,0.0,6.0
high the rugby football union referees manager claimed kaplan made three major errors which changed the outcome of sunday match,0.0,20.0
england were beaten 19-13 by the irish in dublin their third straight defeat in the 2005 six nations,0.0,18.0
the international rugby board will be disappointed high told the daily mail,1.0,12.0
jonathan kaplan is in the top 20 in the world but that wasn an international performance,0.0,16.0
it would not have been acceptable in the zurich premiership,0.0,10.0
if one of my referees had done that would have had my backside kicked for making the appointment,1.0,18.0
if any english referee refereed like that in european match there would be an inquest,1.0,15.0

brian moore believes the england captain should not be full-back,1.0,10.0
jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament in the absence of fly-half jonny wilkinson,0.0,23.0
the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson lock forward,0.0,15.0
and former england captain moore told the bbc full-backs are too far away from the action,1.0,16.0
that not reflection on robinson personally,0.0,6.0
he added just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack which is after all where games usually start and finish,0.0,25.0
moore says lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales france and ireland in this year tournament,1.0,26.0
assertiveness in the pack isn there we re not getting enough people into the breakdowns he explained,0.0,17.0
wer not getting quick ball which means the backs are being stifled,1.0,12.0
their creativity depends on quick ball and we re not getting that,1.0,12.0
with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon chance,0.0,23.0
and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are good opportunity to experiment further,1.0,17.0
the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don have the requisite experience moore added,1.0,28.0
you can do anything about that but play them,0.0,9.0
there are players who have been knocking on the door it time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there nothing on them,0.0,28.0
we then go into next season with greater certainty of who can and can not handle the pressure of international rugby,0.0,21.0
wales number eight michael owen says replacing gareth thomas as wales captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad,1.0,23.0
you dream about playing for wales but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country he said,1.0,22.0
it an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side but it will be massive honour,0.0,21.0
coach mike ruddock says the 24-year-old should take the armband from broken thumb victim thomas against scotland,1.0,17.0
ruddock praised owen contribution as vice-captain and pack leader in this year wins over england italy and france notably his role in the second-half in paris following thomas injury,1.0,29.0
the 22-cap dragons man says that thomas will be badly missed though,0.0,12.0
gareth is going to be massive loss because he is brilliant player and he has done fantastic job since he has been captain said owen,1.0,25.0
he has put his own unique stamp on things,0.0,9.0
we are going to miss him but the strength of the squad is shown when you have someone like kevin morgan to step in,0.0,24.0
owen admitted the grand slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no-one was getting carried away with the three victories over england italy and france,1.0,27.0
we can get ahead of ourselves he said,0.0,8.0
we have massive game next up and we are just looking forward to preparing for that,0.0,16.0
scotland are improving all the time,0.0,6.0
like us they did well in france and were unlucky not to get win,1.0,14.0

italy coach john kirwan believes his side can upset england as the six nations wooden spoon battle hots up,1.0,19.0

we have to make sure the england and france games are tough for them,1.0,14.0
england have not been having the best of championships,1.0,9.0
that is big one for us and them and am sure my players will rise to the occasion he said,0.0,20.0
but kirwan admits that lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to london,0.0,19.0
roland de marigny and luciano orquera had miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to scotland as chris paterson stole the show to give the hosts much-needed 18-10 victory,0.0,31.0
kirwan said the kicking was the decisive factor in scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time,0.0,24.0
but have lot of confidence in my players and am positive we can put everything together against england,1.0,18.0
england meanwhile are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee jonathan kaplan not gone against them in the second half in dublin,1.0,29.0
first mark cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half charlie hodgson kick and then kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if josh lewsey had touched down after being driven over ireland line,0.0,37.0
but centre jamie noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats,1.0,17.0
we definitely improved against an in-form irish side he said,0.0,10.0
we went to dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete and think we showed that,0.0,18.0
we have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the italy game,1.0,17.0
we are under no illusions that it is going to be easy but we definitely need win,0.0,17.0
england have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats including france in paris last season and have lost four in row under andy robinson,0.0,27.0

wood ireland can win grand slam,0.0,6.0
former captain keith wood believes ireland can win only their second grand slam and first since 1948 in this year rbs six nations championship,1.0,24.0
after claiming their first triple crown for 19 years last season wood tips his former team-mates to go one better,1.0,20.0
things have been building up over the past few years and think this is the year for ireland he told bbc sport,0.0,22.0
there is great chance to win grand slam,0.0,8.0
lot of things are in our favour with england and france at home,0.0,13.0
ireland have finished runners-up three times including last year since the old five nations became six in 2000 and not finished outside the top three in the past five years,0.0,30.0
despite being without flanker keith gleeson coach eddie sullivan has not had to contend with the sort of casualty lists that have hit england and scotland in particular prior to the tournament,0.0,32.0
for ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far wood added,1.0,29.0
it is going to be tough and we need to take all the luck and opportunities that come our way,0.0,20.0
ireland last game of the tournament is against wales in cardiff fixture they have not lost since 1983,1.0,18.0
but despite their traditional hospitality when the irish are visiting wood believes wales might end their four-match losing run against england in cardiff,0.0,23.0
so many of the major england players have either retired in the last year or are injured that think it will be very hard for them down in cardiff wood added,1.0,31.0
wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams,1.0,31.0

when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential,0.0,15.0
ireland coach eddie sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season six nations championship,1.0,20.0
he decreed after the 2003 world cup that players should have decent conditioning period during the year,0.0,17.0
that became reality at the end of last summer with 10-week period at the start of the this season,1.0,19.0
it may have annoyed his scottish and in particularly welsh cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league,0.0,24.0
we will say nothing of mike ruddock poaching eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday,0.0,18.0
but like sullivan he was well within his rights particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it,1.0,25.0
the irfu has thrown their weight behind sullivan who must be glad that in the main there is centrally-controlled contracts,0.0,20.0
bar keith gleeson who is just returning from broken leg everyone of sullivan squad is fit fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season campaign,0.0,28.0
but doubt whether sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players,0.0,14.0
he is not that sort of person,0.0,7.0
however he may look at the overworked and injury-hit england wales and france squads whose players have been overworked and then pat himself on the back for his foresight,1.0,29.0
but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game,0.0,25.0
already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season,1.0,18.0
first grand slam since karl mullen led the team to clean sweep in 1948,0.0,14.0
with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down everything looks perfectly placed,0.0,22.0
but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman,0.0,14.0
under the burden of great expectations ireland have crumpled,1.0,9.0
take the triple crown-winning side of 1985 under mick doyle,1.0,10.0
they were expected to up the ante further for grand slam only the second in ireland history,0.0,17.0
you see ireland in any sport love to be downsized,0.0,10.0
then they can go out and prove point to the contrary,0.0,11.0
it is the nature of the beast,0.0,7.0
but sullivan side are very capable of proving salient point this season,1.0,12.0
after their first triple crown for 19 years they can live up to their success and take further step up the ladder,1.0,22.0
sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players and they have repaid him in spades and there is more to come,1.0,23.0
he has some old dogs in his squad but he will come to this season championship with different box of tricks and new verve to succeed,1.0,26.0
ireland can indeed succeed but just whisper it,1.0,8.0
wales are hopeful that openside flanker martyn williams could be fit for saturday rbs nations championship opener against england in cardiff,1.0,21.0
williams was expected to miss the match with disc problem in his neck but has been making speedy recovery,0.0,19.0
he will have tests in the next 48 hours and we are pretty optimistic he is getting there wales team physiotherapist mark davies said,1.0,24.0
it has been frustrating but he is on the mend he has made good progress,0.0,15.0
last week williams along with fellow flanker colin charvis who is unlikely to play for at least month while he recovers from foot injury was all but ruled out of the millennium stadium clash,0.0,34.0
with williams initially thought to be struggling the signs pointed towards wales coach mike ruddock handing first cap to former wales under-21 skipper richie pugh,1.0,25.0
cardiff blues flanker williams 29 offers considerable experience and if he is declared fit then ruddock might be tempted to include him in the back row,0.0,26.0
charvis will be reviewed by the wales medical staff next monday but davies admitted that there was only an outside chance of him being fit to face france in wales third championship game on 26 february,1.0,36.0
wales other injury concern is pugh fellow neath-swansea ospreys player sonny parker as the centre has trapped nerve in his neck,1.0,21.0
sonny injury is still an issue davies said,1.0,8.0
it is still painful and irritable,0.0,6.0
we will run the rule of thumb over him in the next couple of days,0.0,15.0
ruddock will name his starting line-up for the england game at 1830 gmt on tuesday evening as wales target their first victory in cardiff over the world champions since 1993,0.0,30.0
scrum-half matt dawson is an injury doubt for england six nations opener against wales next weekend,1.0,16.0
the world cup winner missed wasps 12-9 loss to bath on saturday after injuring his right calf,0.0,17.0
wasps coach warren gatland said he got fitness test in the week but he got good chance of playing,0.0,19.0
gloucester andy hazell and leicester star lewis moody also received knocks during their respective league matches but should be fit for wales next week,1.0,24.0
if dawson is not fit to face wales robinson will have to choose from gloucester andy gomarsall or leicester youngster harry ellis,0.0,22.0
jamie noon is another player on the sidelines after he limped off in the first half against saracens on friday with dead leg,0.0,23.0
the centre who is in line for first six nations start against wales will have to wait 48 hours before knowing the state of his injury,1.0,26.0
wales could follow england lead by training with rugby league club,0.0,11.0
england have already had three-day session with leeds rhinos and wales are thought to be interested in similar clinic with rivals st helens,1.0,23.0
saints coach ian millward has given his approval but if it does happen it is unlikely to be this season,0.0,20.0
saints have week training in portugal next week while wales will play england in the opening six nations match on february,1.0,21.0
we have had an approach from wales confirmed saints spokesman,1.0,10.0
it in the very early stages but it is something we are giving serious consideration to,0.0,16.0
"st helens who are proud of their welsh connections are obvious partners for the welsh rugby union despite spat in 2001 over the collapse of kieron cunningham proposed 500,000 move to union side swansea",0.0,34.0
similar cross-code deal that took iestyn harris from leeds to cardiff in 2001 did go through before the talented stand-off returned to the 13-man code with bradford bulls,0.0,28.0
kel coslett who famously moved from wales to league in the 1960s is currently saints football manager while clive griffiths wales defensive coach is former st helens player and is thought to be the man behind the latest initiative,1.0,39.0

sale sharks director of rugby philippe saint-andre has re-opened rugby club-versus-country debate,1.0,12.0
sale host bath in the powergen cup on friday but the frenchman has endured difficult week with six players away on england six nations training camp,1.0,26.0
it an important game but we ve just the one full session,1.0,12.0
it the same for everyone but we need to manage it,0.0,11.0
if five players or more are picked for your country they should move the date of the game he told bbc sport,1.0,22.0
unless the authorities agree to make changes saint-andre believes england national team will suffer as clubs opt to sign foreigners and retired internationals,0.0,23.0
that not good for the politics of the english team or for english rugby he argues,0.0,16.0
it is an issue he has taken up before most notably during the autumn internationals when sale lost all three zurich premiership matches they played,0.0,25.0
now he fears it could derail the club hopes of cup silverware after eight players including captain jason robinson and fly-half charlie hodgson were away with their countries,0.0,28.0
we re in the quarter-finals it always better to play at home than away and it great opportunity he added,0.0,20.0
but we have to be careful,0.0,6.0
bath have just been knocked out of europe and will make it tough game,1.0,14.0
it also comes at the end of very very difficult week,0.0,11.0
sebastien bruno been with france jason white with scotland and there are six with england that eight players plus injuries 13 players out of squad of 31,1.0,27.0

the winger is carrying shoulder injury and the national team management believe he requires time on the sidelines,0.0,18.0
as result he misses the cherry and white quarter-final at home to bristol,0.0,13.0
under the elite player squad agreement england wanted second opinion which they can do director of rugby nigel melville told the gloucester citizen,1.0,23.0
they obviously want him for international rugby and we want him for club rugby in what is very important game for us,1.0,22.0
the surgeon who carried out his operation said he was fine for us but england say he is still vulnerable to be damaged again and want him on full rehab programme,0.0,31.0
simpson-daniel added ve said to nigel want to be back playing and that means if everything goes well this week can target the worcester game on 29 january for return,1.0,30.0

the 21-year-old blues prop is the only uncapped player in wales six nations squad gaining chance in the absence of ospreys loose-head duncan jones,1.0,24.0

to be fair to him he not quite there with the scrummaging yet but nobody can fault his effort commitment and attitude,0.0,22.0
john very strong man and is eager for the challenge if he pitched in he won let anyone down,0.0,19.0
he developing quickly but hope he isn pushed too quickly in way that would hurt his development,0.0,17.0
ruddock hopes that the selection of yapp and dragons lock ian gough out of the international reckoning since falling out with former coach steve hansen will send message to other players in wales,1.0,33.0
john and ian have been rewarded for impressing during the heineken cup competition said ruddock,0.0,15.0

england coach andy robinson says english rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players careers,1.0,17.0
he will be without host of big names for the six nations as the intensity of professional rugby union hits players,0.0,21.0
injuries are part of the sport but we have to have look at the amount of injuries that occur in the english season robinson told bbc sport,0.0,27.0
think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers,0.0,15.0
robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the six nations with the likes of jonny wilkinson mike tindall and will greenwood injured,0.0,23.0
rugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago,1.0,17.0
as result three of the major stakeholders in english rugby have launched an injury audit to find out how players are coping,1.0,22.0
the audit is jointly funded by the professional rugby players association the rugby football union and premier rugby,1.0,18.0
as far as robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored,0.0,12.0
think there an injury audit coming out in march that got some great information in there that think everybody in the english game has got to look at he said,0.0,30.0
if we don the situation is going to get worse and not better so think rugby as whole has got to look at this,1.0,24.0

he tore pectoral muscle against the ospreys on boxing day an injury that would have kept him out for the season,0.0,21.0
realising would be unable to play this season the club and agreed to end my contract early said hodges,1.0,19.0
it allows me to move back to the us and pursue opportunities there and allows the scarlets to look to the next generation,0.0,23.0
the scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after disappointing heineken cup campaign with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks,0.0,27.0
scarlets chief executive stuart gallacher confirmed that 17 of the current squad would be out of contract in the summer,1.0,20.0

an amalgamated under-18 side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday against italy at the gnoll,0.0,23.0
but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students,1.0,19.0
as result traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled,0.0,16.0
the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches,1.0,19.0
the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union reverend eldon phillips said it is shame that fixtures can not be maintained this year,1.0,24.0
the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches,0.0,22.0
the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge that is representative rugby but this year that opportunity will be denied them,0.0,28.0
players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones rob howley jon humphreys darren morris martyn williams and ceri sweeney,0.0,30.0
former scotland international finlay calder fears civil war at the sru could seriously hamper his country rbs six nations campaign,1.0,20.0
four members of the executive board including the chairman david mackay have resigned after simmering row,1.0,16.0
and calder said this is terrible news for every level of scottish rugby,1.0,13.0
david is successful businessman and thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level it was him,1.0,21.0
mackay executive board has been in power struggle with the general committee which contains members elected by scotland club sides,1.0,20.0
he has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can be run by amateurs said calder,1.0,28.0
in fact don understand why we are still having this argument 10 years after professionalism arrived,0.0,16.0
but don believe the rest of the sru will take this lying down,0.0,13.0
think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and ultimately it is them who pull the strings,0.0,18.0
so wouldn be surprised if they reviewed their position,0.0,9.0
but in the wider picture what message does this send out,0.0,11.0
he thought the work of scotland coaches who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side would be made much more difficult,0.0,25.0
matt williams and willie anderson must be wondering what have we walked into here,0.0,14.0
and we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at time when we should be looking forward to the six nations championship,0.0,24.0
am very very disappointed more than you can imagine,0.0,9.0
why do so many scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough,0.0,18.0
there used to be one subliminal moment during year in irish rugby that stood out more than most,1.0,18.0
well at least there used to one,0.0,7.0
now there is handful to look back with mixture of satisfaction and sorrow,0.0,13.0
it has been quite year for the irish and not just with eddie sullivan triple crown winning international outfit either,1.0,20.0
right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game,0.0,19.0
but most of the kudos will go to sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for 29 years but also finished their autumn campaign with 100 record,0.0,35.0
for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the rbs six nations,1.0,18.0
but in the three games in november which included victory over tri-nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa ireland finsihed the year on high,0.0,25.0
the 18-12 victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in 1965,1.0,21.0
that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer,0.0,16.0
those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against france were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months,0.0,20.0
but the big one of course was the 19-13 defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf,1.0,20.0
the winning try was conceived in sullivan mind perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey,1.0,19.0
for me the try of the championship,0.0,7.0
sullivan career is now in vertical take-off mode,0.0,8.0
it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway-based coach to head the lions test side,0.0,19.0
not only that but fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand,0.0,20.0
there can be no doubt that ireland representation will be the biggest ever albeit in proposed 44-man squad,0.0,18.0
in brian driscoll and paul connell ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy,0.0,15.0
gordon arcy whose career began as teenager back in 1999 finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament,1.0,23.0
but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well,1.0,24.0
the under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by powerful all black side in the decider,0.0,31.0
the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to england in the six nations under-21 tournament,1.0,24.0
on the provincial front leinster for second year in succession blew it when the heineken cup looked good wager,0.0,19.0
while ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession it was munster again flying the flag for the irish,1.0,25.0
looking to reach their third final they went down 37-32 to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road,1.0,30.0
how wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody guess,0.0,20.0
ulster meanwhile just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game,1.0,30.0
ulster however took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall,0.0,14.0
the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the celtic league,0.0,24.0
leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005 but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing,0.0,25.0
on the down side irish rugby was hit by number of tragedies,1.0,12.0
teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under-19 world cup game in durban,1.0,21.0
that happened only 10 days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools cup success since 1977,0.0,19.0
the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity larger than life character doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in 1985 the last time that goal had been achieved before this season,1.0,46.0
ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known londonderry ym player jim huey coleraine jonathan hutchinson and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole,0.0,23.0
they all passed away long before the full-time whistle,0.0,9.0
matt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugby,1.0,22.0
the chairman chief executive and three non-executive directors all departed in row over the game future direction,0.0,17.0
but williams said want to make it clear that committed totally to scottish rugby,1.0,14.0
ve brought my family here and we ve immersed ourselves in scottish life,0.0,13.0
there no way that walking away,0.0,6.0
however he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute,0.0,12.0
like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation he said,1.0,15.0
when you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make difference then there are always people who will begrudge you who are jealous and want to try to drag you down,0.0,35.0
when you have that situation you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through,0.0,18.0
there was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the case,1.0,34.0
like all good coaches you go and ask for an increase,0.0,11.0
but we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that,0.0,16.0
the idea that we are lighting cigars with 20 notes while the rest of scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue,1.0,20.0
we also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team,1.0,16.0
but let me give you the truth,0.0,7.0
our irish counterparts whom we have to compete with in few days time had 70 days together at the summer,0.0,20.0
they are currently in camp now and they will have another 21 days in camp before the six nations,0.0,19.0
that means they will have 91 days away from their club from july until the six nations,1.0,17.0
we on the other hand will have 16,0.0,8.0
there must be win-win philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after both groups winning not competing,1.0,22.0

used to take two steps and fall over but now can run and it is all coming back and lot more quickly than ever thought it would,1.0,27.0
to play for the all blacks would be the highest honour could get,0.0,13.0
that is the long-term goal and you have to start somewhere,0.0,11.0

feel physically that could play for another season but playing week in and week out in the premiership is full-time occupation and only want to be out there for the right reasons,0.0,32.0

he is the only man to captain the lions twice and he also led england to six nations grand slam,0.0,20.0
johnson also had huge success as captain of leicester guiding the tigers to back to back heineken cup victories and several premiership titles,1.0,23.0

we hold him in such high esteem said lomu,0.0,9.0
he is such great leader and am just honoured to be on the same pitch,0.0,15.0
last saturday one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world,1.0,16.0
that statement was made to look little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham,0.0,15.0
but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level at the end of richly entertaining autumn series,0.0,21.0
the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion with australia triumph in london followed by france capitulation to new zealand,0.0,23.0
clearly there is no number one side in the world at the moment declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney,1.0,23.0
there are four five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about,1.0,29.0
while that bodes well for rugby as whole it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for decade,0.0,28.0
while the wallabies all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year europe finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray,0.0,36.0
and for the first time in more than decade it will not simply be straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title,1.0,25.0
that owes much to ireland continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays,0.0,28.0
who secured first triple crown in 19 years last season could go one better and win their first five six nations title since 1985,1.0,24.0
they start with away games against italy and scotland before england and france come to lansdowne road,0.0,17.0
their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland self-belief while ronan gara late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie sullivan side can now close out tight games,1.0,35.0
not that england or france who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them will lay down quietly,1.0,22.0
dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio they still have the personnel to prosper,0.0,27.0
the narrow defeat to australia was timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden but the fresh shoots of post-world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson,0.0,35.0
fresh desire to regain former heights is evident and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff fourth title in six years is within reach,1.0,29.0
are in familiar revival territory but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style,0.0,17.0
while south africa over-confidence in cardiff made for closer scoreline than expected wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory,1.0,36.0
if mike ruddock can coax reliable set-piece platform from his pack there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february,0.0,22.0
in state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with superb victory over australia,0.0,15.0
stunning defeat to argentina their first loss since the world cup could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency,0.0,19.0
but the manner of new zealand 45-6 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard,0.0,27.0
fortunately for the french the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining,1.0,14.0
after two reasonable performances against australia the scots humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that win over one of the major nations was imminent,1.0,30.0
while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts,0.0,23.0
who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship,1.0,29.0
as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february,0.0,28.0

the kiwis shocked the rugby world with 9-3 triumph in wellington sparking great celebrations across the country but bedell-sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk,0.0,33.0
their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official new zealand tour to europe,1.0,18.0
the tourists won their early games with quick-thinking inventive approach but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left roving forward free to disrupt opposition attacks,0.0,30.0
the tactic was effective two late tries seeing the kiwis to 12-7 win over scotland before ireland were despatched 15-0 in dublin,0.0,22.0

the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations before 19-5 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller,0.0,23.0

he added we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation,1.0,28.0
equally we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in continuous tournament and hopefully the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure,1.0,23.0
moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing pickering argued,0.0,36.0
the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for global integrated season will also be discussed,1.0,29.0
pickering added it very early days and there are number of caveats associated with it not least the revenue from the broadcasters which is extremely important,0.0,26.0

captaincy offers challenging environment for any player especially following in the footsteps of lawrence dallaglio and before him the world cup captain martin johnson,1.0,24.0
but am confident jonny has what it takes to do an outstanding job as we look ahead towards the next rugby world cup in france and look forward to working with him,0.0,32.0

the japanese rugby football union jrfu says it has yet to receive formal presentation from the hkrfu,0.0,17.0
at this stage we are only considering hosting the event by ourselves said jrfu secretary koji tokumasu,0.0,17.0
we can not examine any proposal unless we get it in definitive form,0.0,13.0

dallaglio his own man to the end,0.0,7.0
controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout glittering international career,1.0,17.0
even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season,0.0,21.0
but then dallaglio has always been his own man,1.0,9.0
ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions,0.0,11.0
to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong,1.0,9.0
an integral part of sustained period of success for england dallaglio crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003,1.0,27.0
rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby,0.0,23.0
never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way,0.0,34.0
dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993,1.0,23.0
it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born,0.0,22.0
displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard,0.0,29.0
within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captain band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa,1.0,33.0
although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team-mate martin johnson he played massive role in the 2-1 series victory,0.0,21.0
but after building up seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglio career hit the buffers at speed in 1999,0.0,16.0
first came the last-minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england grand slam,1.0,27.0
worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy,0.0,16.0
with sensational allegations of drug use of which he was subsequently cleared splashed across the front pages devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper,1.0,24.0
but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as lieutenant to new captain johnson,0.0,25.0
as member of new-look england side on the long road to world cup glory journey not without mishaps as succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as key performer once again,1.0,33.0
yet another setback arrived in 2001 as serious knee injury cut short dallaglio involvement on the lions tour to australia,0.0,20.0
rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen,0.0,29.0
one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as close quarters number eight of the highest calibre,0.0,30.0
the only player to play every minute of england world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters,1.0,40.0
following johnson retirement dallaglio career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain,1.0,15.0
while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio second spell as captain losing five of their eight post-world cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations,1.0,45.0
dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country,0.0,38.0
the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable,0.0,12.0
the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglio role as captain,0.0,22.0
but it is as player that england will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old,0.0,14.0
although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio massive influence on english rugby,0.0,32.0
leicester withstood stunning wasps comeback to win pulsating heineken cup encounter at the causeway stadium,1.0,15.0

fly-half goode was the tigers hero kicking 22 points in total while leicester overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told,0.0,20.0
even their lack of discipline in defence which presented the admirable van ginsberg with 26 points could not undo them as they held out for famous win,0.0,27.0
lawrence dallaglio team have now got it all to do in the quest for quarter-final place given that two of their last three games are away against leicester and biarritz,1.0,30.0
however wasps rugby director warren gatland warned his side will will not relinquish their european title without fight,0.0,18.0
if we lose next week then we are struggling said gatland,1.0,11.0
but we don want to give this trophy away,0.0,9.0
we worked so hard to win it last season we will go down fighting,0.0,14.0
we have got to get our scrum right next week it is the biggest cause for concern,0.0,17.0
leicester coach john wells saluted the outstanding work of graham rowntree and julian white who were magnificent up front,0.0,19.0
they were the backbone of our performance today said wells,0.0,10.0

another south african infringement minute later led to ireland first points gara took quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an irish try,1.0,25.0
the springboks could feel hard done by as captain john smit had his back to the play when gara pounced after referee honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements,0.0,35.0
stung by the score the south africans almost replied with try of their own within 60 seconds with geordan murphy ankle-tap tackle denying certain try for percy montgomery,0.0,28.0
however the springboks did win penalty minute later which montgomery easily slotted to cut ireland lead to 5-3,1.0,18.0
ireland got out of jail when the south africans had three-to-one overlap near the irish line only to waste the chance,0.0,21.0

sustained irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another gara penalty,1.0,12.0
however montgomery responded quickly by slotting over superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut ireland lead to five points again,1.0,22.0
montgomery then burst through the irish defence in the 48th minute and it took superb girvan dempsey tackle to prevent try,1.0,21.0
the south africans suffered double-blow in the 52nd minute when schalk burger was sin-binned for the second week in row after killing the ball and gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty,1.0,33.0
in the 61st minute hickie was left frustrated by poor pass from girvan dempsey as chance to seal the match was wasted,0.0,22.0
however late tackle on brian driscoll enabled gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended ireland lead to 17-6,1.0,22.0
however two montgomery penalties had ireland lead in peril again as the springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining,1.0,22.0
south africa produced huge effort in the closing minutes but ireland held on to claim deserved victory,1.0,17.0

the well-drilled and sharper pumas out-played and out-thought ireland in the early stages,0.0,13.0
indiscipline allowed argentina leinster fly-half contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with straightforward penalty,1.0,17.0
he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked ragged ireland with the first try of the game,1.0,21.0
ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts,0.0,25.0
gara finally got ireland on the board with dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later,1.0,26.0
playing into strong wind and rain ireland continued to come second best in tight situations and turnovers began to mount up against rugged defence,0.0,24.0

the second-half started as the first had ended,0.0,8.0

we didn want to put pressure on ourselves but we are thankful we have achieved that and brought through some young talent at the same time that can hopefully play for the england 15s in few years,0.0,37.0

ma nonu then found his way through the barbarians defence to give his side 19-7 half-time lead,0.0,17.0
the hosts failed to ignite in the second half and the moment gear scored his second just after the interval there was only ever going to be one winner,0.0,29.0

ally warnock clawed back three points for borders but they were soon hit by another double-blow,0.0,16.0
first mark blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper andy ward,1.0,31.0
even worse was to come for borders when larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break the second of which also led to kelly brown being sin-binned,1.0,28.0
the hosts gave themselves glimmer of hope immediately after the restart however when warnock struck penalty at the other end,0.0,20.0
and he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale,0.0,11.0

the 31-year-old world cup winning scrum-half has impressed since joining the london side from northampton this summer on one-year contract,0.0,20.0
wasps coach warren gatland told the daily mirror we have not yet offered matt new contract but we will be doing so,1.0,22.0
very happy with his contribution and think he good enough to play for another couple of years,1.0,17.0
dawson played vital part in england world cup win last year but has fallen out of favour with new coach andy robinson after missing training session in september,0.0,28.0
however he hopes the new deal will help him regain his england place,1.0,13.0
rugby is still my priority and there still burning desire within me to play the best rugby possibly can he said,0.0,21.0
know within myself if was given the chance could play for england again,0.0,13.0
know fit enough strong enough skilful enough,0.0,7.0
leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sunday return heineken cup clash with wasps as further springboard to an england recall for the six nations,1.0,25.0
healey who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 world cup has been in good form in the tigers resurgence this season,1.0,22.0
definitely still have ambitions to play for england healey told the bbc,1.0,12.0
we will have to see what happens after the previous autumn tests but when look at the current squad definitely feel there is place there for me,0.0,27.0
healey who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career has reverted to the wing where he won most of his england caps,1.0,26.0
after recovering from trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the tigers revival,0.0,24.0
had six weeks out but fortunately have resumed the sort of form had before he said,0.0,16.0
am basically playing where it best suits leicester,0.0,8.0
obviously can play scrum-half fly-half or full-back at moment notice,0.0,10.0
but playing on the wing actually gives me bigger free role to come in where am not expected and influence things,0.0,21.0
that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps-leicester trilogy in recent weeks,0.0,16.0
first healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the tigers 17-17 draw in their premiership meeting on 21 november,1.0,28.0
then in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered superb cross-kick for martin corry to score the tigers third try,1.0,30.0
caught cozza eye couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score healey recalled,1.0,31.0
healey twice heineken cup winner believes last sunday match was up there with some of the biggest club contests he has played in,1.0,23.0
it was very intense occasion and very destructive game he recalled,0.0,11.0
there was not huge amount of rugby played but it was great game to be involved in,1.0,17.0
after about 15 minutes thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way,0.0,31.0
the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come,0.0,28.0
but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed rugby version of rocky ii,1.0,28.0
there was lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only case of job half done he added,0.0,22.0
it was the first of two-leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result,0.0,25.0
think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end think we did,0.0,16.0
we have got to show the same desire again this week,0.0,11.0
bath have signed their former scrum-half andy williams on short-term deal from the neath-swansea ospreys,1.0,15.0
wales international williams whose contract with the welsh region was due to expire in june has agreed contract until the end of the season,1.0,24.0
with martyn wood injury likely to keep him out until february bath need experienced back-up to nick walshe,0.0,18.0
said williams when this opportunity presented itself did not really have to think twice about it,0.0,16.0
williams capped by wales against romania in 2003 should figure in the match squad for monday zurich premiership match at sale sharks,0.0,22.0
he lost his ospreys starting place to new zealander jason spice and has fallen further behind in the pecking order,0.0,20.0
the welsh region has two outstanding young no prospects in richie rees and rhodri wells,0.0,15.0
bath director of rugby jack rowell though believes williams fits the bill perfectly,1.0,13.0
he has been playing regular heineken cup and celtic league rugby and he has great affection for bath rowell told bath official website,1.0,23.0
we are delighted to be able to welcome him back to the club,0.0,13.0
mike tindall agent has warned bath they have until next week to improve their contract offer to the england man or risk losing him to rival club,1.0,27.0
dipo alli says he has received an offer for tindall which dwarfs bath deal and that two other clubs want to talk,1.0,22.0
mike does not want to go into the six nations worrying about where he will be playing his club rugby next season alli told the guardian newspaper,0.0,27.0
it is up to bath owner andrew brownsword,0.0,8.0
he has to make it happen,0.0,6.0
tindall is out of contract at the end of the season but it is understood that brownsword is unwilling to break the club salary structure to accommodate the 26-year-old demands,0.0,30.0
but alli insists the player is worth more than bath have put on the table,0.0,15.0
mike has been at bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive the agent added,1.0,25.0
but brownsword has to recognise mike value and we want to resolve things by the end of next week,1.0,19.0
england centre mike tindall is to seek second opinion before having surgery on foot injury that could force him to miss the entire six nations,1.0,25.0
the bath player was already out of the opener against wales on february because of hand problem,0.0,17.0
mike had specialist review on fracture in his right mid foot said england doctor simon kemp,1.0,16.0
before final decision is made on surgery medical teams have decided he should see second specialist,0.0,16.0
england coach andy robinson is already without centre will greenwood and flanker richard hill while fly-half jonny wilkinson is certain to miss at least the first two games,1.0,28.0
robinson is expected to announce his new-look england line-up on monday for the match at the millennium stadium,1.0,18.0
and newcastle 18-year-old centre mathew tait is set to stand in for tindall alongside club team-mate jamie noon,0.0,18.0
meanwhile tindall is targeting return to action before the end of the regular zurich premiership season on 30 april,0.0,19.0
he will also aim to be back to full fitness before the lions tour to new zealand this summer,0.0,19.0
has there been better six nations match than saturday epic in paris,0.0,12.0
and can the welsh revival continue all the way to first grand slam since 1978,1.0,15.0
those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as whole after scintillating display in paris,1.0,20.0
welsh legend mervyn davies member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the 1970s hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades,1.0,28.0
martyn williams wales two-try scorer on the day called it one of the most surreal games have ever played in,0.0,20.0
crestfallen france coach bernard laporte simply observed there was french half and there was welsh half,1.0,16.0
and what half it was for the red dragonhood transforming 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period,0.0,25.0
but while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure the final quarter told us whole lot more about this welsh side,0.0,32.0
that they recovered from battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time then reverse it on the resumption was remarkable enough,0.0,25.0
but in resisting seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in nail-biting final five minutes wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve,0.0,25.0
in international rugby any of the top seven sides can beat each other on given day but the great sides are those that win the close contests on consistent basis,0.0,30.0
england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered,0.0,28.0
wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in similar light,1.0,15.0
but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline,0.0,23.0
ten of the 22 on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced 33-5 in paris two years ago,1.0,21.0
but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the 2003 world cup wales have rediscovered much of what made them great rugby nation in the first place,1.0,30.0
the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class noted coach mike ruddock,1.0,29.0
the likes of michael owen gethin jenkins dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer lions tour to new zealand,0.0,27.0
and players like stephen jones martyn williams shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve,0.0,26.0
jones after his superb man-of-the-match display observed that we are very happy camp now,0.0,14.0
ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad,0.0,30.0
so evident in that magical second-half spell in paris also stems from style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s,1.0,25.0
if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats,1.0,25.0
similarly wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches and that forward power mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important,0.0,25.0
so on to murrayfield where wales have not won on their last three visits,1.0,14.0
while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive the players will set about the task of beating scotland,0.0,20.0
only then with the visit of ireland to finish can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s and writing their own names into welsh legend,0.0,29.0
wales silent on grand slam talk,0.0,6.0
rhys williams says wales are still not thinking of winning the grand slam despite third six nations win,1.0,18.0
that the last thing on our minds at the moment said williams second- half replacement in saturday 24-18 win over france in paris,1.0,23.0
we all realise how difficult task it is to go up to scotland and beat them,0.0,16.0
we ve come unstuck there couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we ll worry about ireland hopefully after we ve beaten scotland,1.0,28.0
with captain gareth thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with broken thumb williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far,1.0,27.0
kevin morgan is probably favourite to replace thomas at full-back leaving williams and hal luscombe to battle for the right wing berth,0.0,22.0
hamstring injury denied luscombe the opportunity to make third successive start but the dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to murrayfield on 13 march,0.0,28.0
hooker robin mcbryde is doubtful after picking up knee injury in paris but centre sonny parker and flanker colin charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection,0.0,32.0
said wales assistant coach scott johnson they ve worked through the weekend and the reports are bit more positive,0.0,19.0
so we re getting couple back and that adds to the depth of the squad,0.0,15.0
scotland secured their first win of the campaign on saturday by grinding out an 18-10 win over italy,1.0,18.0
matt williams side has shown little in attack but johnson insisted the scots will be difficult opposition to break down,1.0,20.0
italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it very hard to win he said,1.0,14.0
so an ugly win can be just as effective as 30 or 40 point victory,0.0,15.0
scotland are hard side and very underrated so we re not taking anything for granted,0.0,15.0
we re not basking in the glory of winning our first three games,0.0,13.0
we ve got to be diligent in our preparation,0.0,9.0
that my job and we ve got to make sure we re focused,1.0,13.0
paul sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed andy farrell as great britain skipper if the wigan star does switch codes to rugby union,1.0,25.0
sculthorpe was vice-captain in the tri-nations and took the st helens captaincy from chris joynt last year,1.0,17.0

financially it could set him up for life,0.0,8.0
if he fancies new challenge then who could fault him,0.0,10.0
sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play,1.0,25.0
sean long sculthorpe saints and lions team-mate has expressed doubts about his international future think sean situation is to do with the sheer number of games we re playing he said,0.0,31.0
the way he looking at it is that if he can extend his career by couple of years by not playing international rugby then he willing to do that,1.0,29.0
the rfl has got to do something about the fixtures,0.0,10.0
we re playing 42 weeks of the year and it too much,0.0,12.0
lot of the niggly injuries that ve suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time,0.0,25.0
st helens have been strongly linked with move for brilliant young forward sonny bill williams and sculthorpe said he would love the 19-year-old to come to knowsley road,1.0,28.0
he great player big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence but who is also very skilful he said,1.0,21.0
love him to come to st helens,0.0,7.0
but you want the best players in your team and he certainly one of the best players in the world,0.0,20.0
leicester say they will not be rushed into making bid for andy farrell should the great britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes,1.0,24.0
we and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage tigers boss john wells told bbc radio leicester,0.0,27.0
at the moment there are still lot of unknowns about andy farrell not least his medical situation,1.0,17.0
whoever does take him on is going to take big big gamble,0.0,12.0
farrell who has had persistent knee problems had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months,0.0,26.0
leicester and saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing farrell if he decides to move to the 15-man game,1.0,26.0
if he does move across to union wells believes he would better off playing in the backs at least initially,1.0,20.0
sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre said wells,1.0,18.0
think england would prefer him to progress to position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards,0.0,28.0
the jury is out on whether he can cross that divide,0.0,11.0
at this club the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in ready-made replacement,0.0,24.0
farrell saga to drag on lindsay,0.0,6.0
wigan chairman maurice lindsay says he does not expect quick solution to the on-going saga of captain andy farrell possible switch to rugby union,1.0,24.0
leicester and saracens are leading the chase for the player but lindsay told the bbc it was not yet done deal,1.0,21.0
as well as the rugby football union the league the individual club and the england coaching team have say so it not quick decision he said,1.0,26.0
he given us 12 years service so if he wants to go we support him,0.0,15.0
the prospect of farrell switching codes has been the main talking point of the super league season so far,0.0,19.0
it came as bolt out of the blue to us admitted lindsay,1.0,12.0
but he very loyal friend to the club so there no question that he deserting us,1.0,16.0
although the move would be lucrative one for both farrell and wigan lindsay said money was not motivating factor for the club,1.0,22.0
the money side of things hasn been concluded but it not the point for wigan he told radio five live,0.0,20.0
shortage of money has never been problem for us,1.0,9.0
even if we did have it under the salary cap we can spend penny of it anyway we rather have the player,0.0,22.0
lindsay also said he understood why rugby union was so interested in signing up farrell,1.0,15.0
it be great loss for us but great boost for them said the warriors chief,0.0,15.0
this guy is an absolute sporting icon,0.0,7.0
he been at the top for so long and has demonstrated so many attributes that you need to make it in tough contact sport,0.0,24.0

you re very lucky to have them whilst you ve got them,0.0,12.0
england will have to negotiate their way through tough draw if they are to win the rugby world cup sevens in hong kong next month,1.0,25.0
the second seeds have been drawn against samoa france italy georgia and chinese taipei,0.0,14.0
the top two sides in each pool qualify but england could face 2001 winners new zealand in the quarter-finals if they stumble against samoa,1.0,24.0
scotland and ireland are in pool together with the all blacks,0.0,11.0
england won the first event of the international rugby board world sevens series in dubai but have slipped to fourth in the table after failing to build on that victory,1.0,30.0
however they beat samoa in the recent los angeles sevens before losing to argentina in the semi-finals,0.0,17.0
england have the ability and determination to win this world cup and create sporting history by being the only nation to hold both the 15s and sevens world cups at the same time said england sevens coach mike friday,1.0,39.0
england have fantastic record in hong kong and have won there the last three years but the world cup is on different level,1.0,23.0
every pool contains teams who have caused upsets before and we will have to work hard to ensure we progress from our group,0.0,23.0
we have not performed consistently to our true potential so far in the irb sevens which has been disappointing but we can only look forward,0.0,25.0
england won the first rugby world cup sevens in 1993 with side that included the likes of lawrence dallaglio and matt dawson,1.0,22.0

one game into his six nations career and gavin henson is already welsh legend,1.0,14.0
mesmeric display against england topped off by his howitzer of match-winning penalty has secured life membership of that particular club,0.0,20.0
at 23 henson has the rugby world at his silver-booted feet,0.0,11.0
and if his natural self-assurance and swagger is shared by his wales team-mates then full-blown revival could be more than just lot of hot air drifting up from the valleys,0.0,30.0
the red dragonhood subdued the red rose army in most areas of the field but henson stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others,0.0,29.0
he announced himself in the game opening salvo with welcome to cardiff greeting for mark cueto on the gain line,0.0,20.0
and his defence was major feature of the match his principal victim poor old or rather young mathew tait,0.0,19.0
the england centre will have spent his 19th birthday on sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once but twice by henson all-enveloping tackles,1.0,29.0
the second time after the interval single-handedly lifted the record millennium stadium crowd at time when england were starting to show menace,0.0,22.0
showing awesome strength henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid-air master predator toying with his helpless prey savouring the kill,0.0,21.0
his kicking game also prospered particularly when he moved to full-back for 10 minutes either side of half-time when his captain gareth thomas was in the sin-bin,1.0,27.0
one huge clearance from tait kick sent england retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half,0.0,26.0
henson was also creativity personified one little chip ahead for shane williams narrowly missed its target precise cross-kick forcing jamie noon to fumble the ball into touch,1.0,27.0
he also had hand in the game only try finished superbly by williams and might have scored himself on the half-hour as he glided into space only to be scragged by tait,0.0,32.0
henson was twice repelled as wales laid siege to the english line after charlie hodgson penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time,1.0,26.0
but he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to deafening din and the outcome of the match fell to him,1.0,23.0
replacement gareth cooper made the most of poor welsh scrum by chipping into space where jason robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle,0.0,25.0
five metres in from the right touchline 44 metres out it was not kick stephen jones who had seen long-range effort fall agonisingly under the bar would have approached with confidence,1.0,31.0
it was out of steve range but looked at gavin and he gave me reassuring nod said thomas,1.0,18.0
henson surveying his date with destiny positively relished the responsibility and the chance to make himself hero,0.0,17.0
without further ado he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of english dominance and 12 years of waiting in cardiff,0.0,22.0
knew was going to get it before even took the kick he said later his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape,0.0,25.0
have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasn problem,0.0,13.0
there were still four minutes for wales to hold out and the frenzy was such that henson could not even hear jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away,1.0,30.0
but it was wales who finished the game on the attack almost snatching second try in thunderous climax,1.0,18.0
just do it implored the front page headline on saturday western mail newspaper,0.0,13.0
and thanks to henson wales did,1.0,6.0
sydney to host north south game,0.0,6.0
sydney will host northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in june or july the australian rugby union aru said on wednesday,1.0,21.0
the match will include players from the lions tour of new zealand,1.0,12.0
the australian rugby union has thrown its support behind proposed north-south match to raise funds for the tsunami appeals the aru said,0.0,22.0
the date is yet to be decided but the most likely venue is sydney olympic stadium,0.0,16.0
aru chief executive gary flowers said the world cricket charity match in melbourne earlier this month had inspired the aru,1.0,20.0
we still need to discuss the options with the irb international rugby board the lions and our sanzar south africa new zealand and australia rugby partners but june or july is seen as better option than march to ensure we have the cream of southern hemisphere rugby available he said,1.0,50.0
wallabies captain george gregan said the charity match was great initiative,0.0,11.0
tri-nations rivals australia new zealand and south africa would feature prominently in southern team against northern side comprised of six nations teams france ireland england wales italy and scotland,0.0,29.0
coach clive woodward lions squad will tour new zealand in june and july including tests on 25 june and july,0.0,20.0
"almost 80,000 fans packed into melbourne cricket ground on 10 january for charity match that raised 5.9m for victims of the asian tsunami",0.0,23.0
the six nations has heralded new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face potential grand slam play-off in three weeks time,1.0,34.0
but before that game in cardiff wales must get past scotland at murrayfield while ireland face the not insignificant task of home fixture with the mercurial french,0.0,27.0
no-one knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on 12 march sublime as in the first half against wales or ridiculous like in the same period against england at twickenham,1.0,33.0
but how the mighty have fallen,0.0,6.0
england sat on rugby summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 grand slam winners,1.0,16.0
but they have lost nine of their 14 matches since that heady night in sydney,0.0,15.0
and they face the ignominy of what could amount to wooden spoon play-off against italy in fortnight,0.0,17.0
england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in 1987,1.0,26.0
coach andy robinson who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september has lost phalanx of world cup stars,0.0,21.0
and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with new team,0.0,18.0
the same year that england ruled the roost woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations,1.0,18.0
and they won only two games against scotland and italy in 2004,0.0,12.0
wales most recent championship title was in 1994 and their last grand slam success came in 1978 in the era of gareth edwards phil bennett jpr williams et al,1.0,29.0
but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of new golden age,0.0,15.0
after several false dawns coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations,0.0,19.0
the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas now out with broken thumb accurate kicking from either fly-half stephen jones or centre gavin henson rampant martyn williams leading the way up front and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams,0.0,44.0
ireland coach eddie sullivan and captain brian driscoll have got their side buzzing too and they are close to shedding the nearly-men tag that has dogged them for the past few years,0.0,32.0
the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runners-up for the past two years to france and england,1.0,20.0
but they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched grand slam in 1948,1.0,16.0
as for scotland they have struggled this decade and the 2004 wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999,1.0,28.0
italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win and can still only account for the scalps of scotland twice and wales since joining the elite in 2000,1.0,31.0
coach john kirwan is passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri but is lacking in raw materials,0.0,17.0
brilliant one minute inept the next,0.0,6.0
but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door,0.0,23.0
ireland though have won three times in their last five meetings,1.0,11.0
welsh romantics would probably prefer glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam,0.0,16.0
but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on 12 march,1.0,27.0
the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up,0.0,23.0
it may have to go the whole way and have nfl-style video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles,0.0,25.0
what the irb does not want is football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself,0.0,19.0
sunday explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948,1.0,23.0
the game was as exciting as it comes with much-improved england side enraged at few decisions that did not go their way,1.0,22.0
there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport blazers,1.0,32.0
referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece,1.0,21.0
doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made,0.0,12.0
after all he has no public recourse to criticism,0.0,9.0
it was the same for simon mcdowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france,1.0,24.0
as far as england were concerned there were queries over mark cueto first half-effort when he went over in the corner from charlie hodgson kick,0.0,25.0
england coach andy robinson referred to similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup,0.0,21.0
on that occasion david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out,0.0,23.0
but you can not have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies,0.0,15.0
perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end,1.0,24.0
lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control,1.0,11.0
however one has to credit ireland flanker johnny connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of touchdown,1.0,21.0
but in rugby everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes,0.0,12.0
the referee also missed england danny grewcock taking out ronan gara off the ball to allow martin corry sunday stroll to the line,0.0,23.0
those were the stand-out moments in classic game between the two old foes,0.0,13.0
but there were many more and one should not take away from those,0.0,13.0
brian driscoll winning try was as well-conceived as they come while charlie hodgson brilliant kicking display was another highlight,1.0,19.0
and ronan gara tremendous ability to control the game was also crucial component,1.0,13.0
but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes,0.0,15.0
two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on,1.0,14.0
the first was denis hickie brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner,1.0,12.0
he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross-field kick then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring certain try,0.0,20.0
ireland second-row colossus paul connell was equally superb,1.0,8.0
england had turned ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating,1.0,16.0
england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in few more tacklers,0.0,15.0
unfortunately he ran into connell who hit him hard very hard and then wrestled the ball away for crucial turnover,0.0,20.0
that spoke volumes about ireland back-foot display with defensive coach mike ford taking bow at the end,0.0,17.0
to win game like that showed that ireland have moved forward,0.0,11.0
it may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships,0.0,14.0
ireland consigned england to their third straight six nations defeat with stirring victory at lansdowne road,1.0,16.0
second-half try from captain brian driscoll and 14 points from ronan gara kept ireland on track for their first grand slam since 1948,1.0,23.0
england scored first through martin corry but had tries from mark cueto and josh lewsey disallowed,1.0,16.0
andy robinson men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 world cup final,0.0,18.0
the defeat also heralded england worst run in the championship since 1987,0.0,12.0
ireland last won the title then the five nations in 1985 but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with wales,0.0,27.0
and eddie sullivan side banished the ghosts of 2003 when england were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the grand slam at lansdowne road,0.0,23.0
in front of supercharged home crowd on dry but blustery day in dublin ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when gara landed fourth-minute drop-goal,1.0,32.0
england took their time to settle but their first real venture into ireland half produced simple score for corry,1.0,19.0
the number eight picked up the ball from the back of ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the irish line racing 25 yards to touch down,0.0,31.0
england fly-half charlie hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left but almost immediately gara winning his 50th cap answered with two penalties in quick succession,1.0,27.0
england were awarded penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes and hodgson the villain at twickenham coolly bisected the posts,1.0,24.0
the first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking but it was ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs,1.0,30.0
series of probes led by the talismanic driscoll back from hamstring injury resulted in penalty but ireland chose to kick for touch,1.0,22.0
from the line-out the ball was recycled back to gara who stroked his second drop-goal this time off the right upright,1.0,21.0
as the interval approached wing josh lewsey was the catalyst for england most promising attack,0.0,15.0
the wasps star raced up his touchline and hodgson cross-kick put in mark cueto for an apparent score but the sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker,0.0,32.0
england began the second half well and had ireland pinned in their own half,1.0,14.0
but another english indiscretion on rare irish break-out awarded gara kick at goal which he missed,0.0,16.0
england pressure continued and wave of attacks saw centre jamie noon dragged down yards from the line before hodgson landed drop-goal,0.0,21.0
ireland raced upfield deft handling from the backs including clever dummy from geordan murphy on hodgson ending with driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts,0.0,32.0
gara missed penalty which would have put ireland nine points clear and the home crowd breathed sigh of relief when hodgson cross-kick was fumbled by lock ben kay near the line,1.0,31.0
anticipation of home win sent the noise level sky-high but gara missed another chance to seal the game with wayward drop-goal attempt,0.0,22.0
inside the last 10 minutes england poured forward spurred on by scrum-half matt dawson who replaced leicester harry ellis,0.0,19.0
but despite one near miss with the pack over the line not checked on the tv replay by referee jonathan kaplan england were unable to pull off face-saving win,0.0,29.0
ireland next face france at lansdowne road in two weeks time before the potential title decider against wales in cardiff,1.0,20.0

england coach andy robinson said he was livid after his side were denied two tries in sunday 19-13 six nations loss to ireland in dublin,1.0,25.0
mark cueto first-half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes,0.0,23.0
there two tries we ve been cost robinson told bbc sport,1.0,11.0
we ve got to go back to technology,1.0,8.0
south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the sale wing to gather,1.0,26.0
kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try,1.0,32.0
think mark cueto scored perfectly legal try and think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson,1.0,22.0
it is how we use the technology,0.0,7.0
it is there and it should be used,0.0,8.0
am still trying to work out the cueto try,0.0,9.0
have looked at both and they both looked tries,0.0,9.0
we are very disappointed and this will hurt there is no doubt about that,0.0,14.0
we are upset now but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that,0.0,28.0
we did everything we could have done to win the game,1.0,11.0
am very proud of my players and with couple of decisions this could have been very famous victory,0.0,18.0
matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop while the likes of charlie hodgson martin corry and lewis moody all came through well,0.0,24.0
josh lewsey was awesome and every one of the forwards stood up out there,0.0,14.0
given the pressure we were under credit must go to all the players,0.0,13.0
we have done everything but win game of rugby but ireland are good side,1.0,14.0

late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy chasing their first away win in the six nations,0.0,18.0
scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back paterson,1.0,20.0
but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life,0.0,10.0
series of drives into scottish territory set up penalty attempt missed by full-back roland de marigny and wayward drop-goal effort from luciano orquera,0.0,23.0
scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes italy after coming up yards short of the line equalised through de marigny penalty,1.0,23.0
italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left-footed de marigny pushed his kick wide,1.0,21.0
scotland finally made the most of rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in ruck,1.0,27.0
as the half wore on both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically if not psychologically on top,0.0,28.0
italy de marigny narrowly missed chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright,0.0,23.0
and scotland capitalised with third paterson penalty on 50 minutes,1.0,10.0
williams side seemed to have found spark from somewhere and after couple of probing attacks paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap,0.0,27.0
with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for marginal forward pass from paterson,1.0,31.0
another paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors,1.0,13.0

in an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as an island of democracy the kyrgyz president askar akaev pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections,1.0,38.0

the use of ink is only one part of general effort to show commitment towards more open elections the german embassy the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes,1.0,36.0

the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system said carlos saldarriaga technical coordinator at cepes,1.0,24.0
farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land,0.0,22.0
the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes,1.0,30.0
one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system with its flagship huaral.org website,1.0,18.0
there farmers can find the prices for local produce as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques,0.0,24.0
the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancay-huaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems,1.0,16.0
water is the main element that unites them all,0.0,9.0
it is precious element in peru coastal areas because it is so scarce and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website,1.0,36.0

we have had an excellent response mainly from young people,0.0,10.0
but we have also had great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women who were seeing computer for the first time in their lives,0.0,26.0
so far the huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers organisations in peru,0.0,27.0

it was already dark when the technicians realised they didn have any light bulbs to test the generator so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs recalls carlos saldarriaga,0.0,33.0
the logical answer was we don sell any so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing,0.0,21.0

search engine firm google has released trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites,1.0,22.0
the autolink feature comes with google latest toolbar and provides links in webpage to amazon.com if it finds book isbn number on the site,1.0,24.0
it also links to google map service if there is an address or to car firm carfax if there is licence plate,0.0,22.0
google said the feature available only in the us adds useful links,0.0,12.0
but some users are concerned that google dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving competitive edge to firms like amazon,0.0,27.0
autolink works by creating link to website based on information contained in webpage even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission,0.0,32.0
if user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then webpage with book unique isbn number would link directly to amazon website,1.0,23.0
it could mean online libraries that list isbn book numbers find they are directing users to amazon.com whether they like it or not,0.0,23.0
websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services,0.0,17.0
dan gillmor founder of grassroots media which supports citizen-based media said the tool was bad idea and an unfortunate move by company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth,0.0,29.0
in statement google said the feature was still only in beta ie trial stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users,1.0,22.0
it said the user can choose never to click on the autolink button and web pages she views will never be modified,1.0,22.0
in addition the user can choose to disable the autolink feature entirely at any time,1.0,15.0
the new tool has been compared to the smart tags feature from microsoft by some users,0.0,16.0
it was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised,0.0,19.0
smart tags allowed microsoft to link any word on web page to another site chosen by the company,0.0,18.0
google said none of the companies which received autolinks had paid for the service,1.0,14.0
some users said autolink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any click through to commercial site,1.0,35.0
cory doctorow european outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group electronic fronter foundation said that google should not be penalised for its market dominance,0.0,24.0
of course google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses,0.0,14.0
but as an end user would want to know can choose to use this service how much is google being paid,1.0,21.0
can substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by google,0.0,11.0
mr doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using autolink or tricked into using the service,1.0,21.0

many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content like tv programmes,1.0,18.0

it is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes,0.0,17.0
the industry has coined the term time-shifting to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want when you want,0.0,22.0
the increased popularity of personal digital video recorders tivo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like sky have also contributed to the trend,0.0,22.0

the uk film council has awarded contract worth 11.5m to arts alliance digital cinema aadc who will set up the network of up to 250 screens,1.0,26.0
aadc will oversee the selection of cinemas across the uk which will use the digital equipment,1.0,16.0
high definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly british and specialist films,0.0,16.0
most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images,1.0,31.0
the new network will double the world total of digital screens,0.0,11.0
cinemas will be given the film on portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to computer server,0.0,20.0
each film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file,0.0,16.0
fiona deans associate director of aadc said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur,0.0,18.0
the film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie,0.0,22.0
people will see the picture quality is bit clearer with no scratches,0.0,12.0

access to specialised film is currently restricted across the uk said pete buckingham head of distribution and exhibition at the uk film council,0.0,23.0
although genuine variety of films is available in central london and few other metropolitan areas the choice for many outside these areas remains limited and the digital screen network will improve access for audiences across the uk digital prints costs less than traditional 35mm print giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films said ms deans,1.0,57.0
"it can cost up to 1,500 to make copy of print for specialist films",0.0,14.0
in the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that,1.0,13.0
distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer,1.0,18.0
the uk digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 1080 pixels,1.0,24.0
separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in may,0.0,17.0
the sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice day in order to recoup costs,0.0,21.0
some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum they don need to be shown twice day explained ms deans,0.0,22.0
cinema will often book 35mm print in for two weeks even if the film is roaring success they can not hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema,1.0,34.0

eu software patent law faces axe,0.0,6.0
the european parliament has thrown out bill that would have allowed software to be patented,1.0,15.0
politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have chance of becoming law,1.0,24.0
during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped,1.0,13.0
the bill was backed by some hi-tech firms saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile,0.0,18.0
hugo lueders european director for public policy at comptia an umbrella organization for technology companies said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would european inventors prosper,0.0,27.0
he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents,1.0,25.0
other proponents of the bill said it was good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software,1.0,29.0
but opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement,0.0,30.0
the proposed law had troubled passage through the european parliament,0.0,10.0
its progress was delayed twice when polish meps rejected plans to adopt it,0.0,13.0
also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee juri said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of meps,0.0,26.0
to become law both the european parliament and qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill,1.0,23.0

research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide,1.0,17.0
the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have very useful second life in poorer nations,0.0,26.0

details of the chip designed to power sony playstation console will be released in san francisco on monday,1.0,18.0
sony ibm and toshiba who have been working on the cell processor for three years will unveil the chip at technology conference,1.0,22.0
the chip is reported to be up to 10 times faster than current processors,1.0,14.0
it is being designed for use in graphics workstations the new playstation console and has been described as supercomputer on chip,1.0,21.0
sony has said the cell processor could be used to bridge the gap between movies and video games,1.0,18.0
special effects and graphics designed for films could be ported for use directly in video game sony told an audience at the e3 exhibition in los angeles last year,0.0,29.0
cell could also be marketed as an ideal technology for televisions and supercomputers and everything in between said kevin krewell the editor in chief of microprocessor report,0.0,27.0
the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together,0.0,15.0
the playstation is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch,0.0,26.0
details of the chip will be released at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco,1.0,17.0

intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light,0.0,19.0
scientists at intel have overcome fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light,1.0,21.0
the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information,0.0,17.0
the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade,0.0,16.0
we ve overcome fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel photonics technology lab,0.0,15.0
writing in the journal nature dr paniccia and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang show how they have made continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors,0.0,38.0
currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it,1.0,33.0
telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved,0.0,32.0
we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia,0.0,19.0
while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances,1.0,39.0
this is despite the fact that silicon is much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables,1.0,25.0
this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips,0.0,17.0
dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material,1.0,27.0
it creates cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said,1.0,17.0
but the intel researchers have found way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into material that can both generate and amplify laser light,1.0,26.0
even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy-to-make filters be tuned across very wide range of frequencies,0.0,24.0
semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in narrow frequency ranges,0.0,13.0
the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it,0.0,24.0
dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses,1.0,33.0

microsoft is working on new version of its internet explorer web browser,1.0,12.0
the revamp has been prompted by microsoft growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers,0.0,19.0
microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser favourite of tech-savvy criminals,1.0,22.0
test versions of the new program called ie are due to be released by the summer,1.0,16.0
the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates microsoft chairman and chief software architect during keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco,0.0,30.0
although details were scant mr gates said ie7 would include new protections against viruses spyware and phishing scams,0.0,18.0
this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information,0.0,30.0
in bid to shore up the poor security in ie microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware,1.0,30.0
earlier this month it released security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes some of which were found in the ie browser,1.0,22.0
microsoft has also made series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security,0.0,15.0
one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of microsoft anti-spyware program,0.0,18.0
an own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005,0.0,13.0
the decision to make internet explorer is widely seen as u-turn because before now microsoft said it had no need to update the browser,1.0,24.0
typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system,1.0,15.0
new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows codenamed longhorn which is due to appear in 2006,1.0,24.0
the current version of internet explorer is four years old and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera,1.0,23.0
there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox,0.0,20.0
in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004,1.0,21.0
estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely,0.0,11.0
according to market statistics gathered by websidestory firefox market share is now about of all users,0.0,16.0
however other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15,0.0,12.0
some technical websites report that majority of their visitors use the firefox browser,0.0,13.0

every month the prices drop and more and more people are trying to switch he said,1.0,16.0
the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription,1.0,27.0
some readers were offered price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator making it hardly worth while swapping,0.0,23.0

broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers,0.0,14.0
12 of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all,0.0,11.0
we discovered huge variety of problems but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier said tim danton editor of pc pro,1.0,35.0
this breaks the code of practice but because that code is voluntary there nothing we or ofcom can do to help he said,0.0,23.0

an indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country,1.0,24.0
tata teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers offices and its own core network,1.0,18.0
the laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections,1.0,19.0
in 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations,1.0,17.0
in this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is bit of task said mr r. sridharan vice president of networks at tata,1.0,28.0
heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult he said,0.0,16.0
in some locations he said permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get,1.0,17.0

this has led chennai-based tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between tata core network and the premises of customers,0.0,27.0
the lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network,1.0,30.0
the hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses,0.0,17.0
"the laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps 2,000 times faster than 512kbps broadband connection but tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps",1.0,30.0
the lasers are also ideal for india because of its climate,0.0,11.0
it particularly suitable as the rain rate is little low and it hardly ever foggy he said,0.0,17.0
in places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds,0.0,19.0
the laser links also take far less time to set up and get working said mr sridharan,1.0,17.0
once we get the other permissions normal time period for set up is few hours he said,0.0,17.0
by contrast he said digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months,0.0,15.0

the amount of spam circulating online could be about to undergo massive increase say experts,0.0,15.0
anti-spam group spamhaus is warning about novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail,1.0,15.0
the program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out,0.0,22.0
spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent,1.0,22.0
before now many spammers have recruited home pcs to act as anonymous e-mail relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail,0.0,25.0
the pcs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program,0.0,27.0
once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers,0.0,14.0
spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines,0.0,22.0
but the novel worm spotted recently by spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place,1.0,30.0
in this way the junk mail gets net address that looks legitimate,1.0,12.0
as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped,1.0,36.0
steve linford director of spamhaus predicted that if lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net e-mail sending infrastructure,0.0,25.0
david stanley uk managing director of filtering firm ciphertrust said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers,0.0,20.0
they are adding to their armoury he said,0.0,8.0
the amount of spam in circulation was still growing said mr stanley but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e-mail meltdown,0.0,27.0
but kevin hogan senior manager at symantec security response said such warnings were premature,0.0,14.0
if something like this mean the end of e-mail then e-mail would have stopped two-three years ago said mr hogan,0.0,20.0
while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too,1.0,38.0
mr hogan said 90 of the junk mail filtered by symantec subsidiary brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses,1.0,26.0

the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents,1.0,26.0
in panel discussion at linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were problem for the open source movement,1.0,20.0
mitchell kapor chairman of the mozilla foundation warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future,0.0,17.0
linux is freely-available alternative to microsoft windows,0.0,7.0
it relies on community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees,0.0,30.0
the attack on software patents comes at time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available,0.0,18.0
other companies are expected to follow suit,0.0,7.0
"there are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted",1.0,24.0
this is view corroborated by the uk patent office,0.0,9.0
some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can afford to take them to court said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office,0.0,43.0
some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue series of patent lawsuits in the future,1.0,16.0
if totally pushed to the wall because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software of course they re going to unleash the wmds mr kapor is reported as saying,0.0,44.0
microsoft did not want to comment directly referring the issue instead to trade body intellect of which it is member,0.0,20.0
as far as intellect is concerned open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems said spokeswoman jill sutherland,1.0,21.0
the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries and not be forced into using one or the other she added,1.0,65.0
reboot ordered for eu patent law,0.0,6.0
european parliament committee has ordered rewrite of the proposals for controversial new european union rules which govern computer-based inventions,0.0,19.0
the legal affairs committee juri said the commission should re-submit the computer implemented inventions directive after meps failed to back it,1.0,21.0
it has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open-source software innovation,1.0,19.0
supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions,1.0,9.0
the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention,1.0,23.0
the draft law suffered setbacks when poland one of the largest eu member states rejected its adoption twice in two months,0.0,21.0
intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure,0.0,19.0
only two meps backed the draft law at the juri meeting with one voting to abstain,0.0,16.0
opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said new first reading of the proposals would give the eu chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states,1.0,32.0
in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted,0.0,14.0
this means that the us-based amazon.com holds patent for its one-click shopping service for example,0.0,15.0
critics are concerned that the directive could lead to similar model happening in europe,0.0,14.0
this they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court,0.0,31.0
supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us,1.0,24.0

almost 70 of those asked in poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people,1.0,18.0
"the survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43 were not willing to hand over personal information online",1.0,19.0
it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net,0.0,13.0
more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm rsa which carried out the poll,1.0,32.0
an estimated 12 million britons now use the net as way of managing their financial affairs,0.0,16.0
security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously by banks in particular,0.0,21.0
don think the threat is overplayed barry beal global security manager for capgemini told the bbc news website,0.0,18.0
he added the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability,1.0,21.0
ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said,1.0,35.0
card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves,0.0,18.0
if we do that they will indemnify us he said,0.0,10.0
many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though,0.0,16.0
one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual identity,1.0,16.0
several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget,1.0,19.0
last year street survey found that more than 70 of people would reveal their password for bar of chocolate,0.0,19.0
on average people have to remember four different passwords,0.0,9.0
some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts,0.0,12.0
those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in desk or in document on their computer,0.0,20.0
in separate survey by rsa 80 said they were fed up with passwords and would like better way to login to work computer systems,1.0,24.0
for many the ideal is single online identity that can be validated once with series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like fingerprint or iris scan with token like smartcard,1.0,32.0
activcard is just one of the many companies like rsa security which has been trying to come up with just that,1.0,21.0
rsa has deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for one-time passcode generation service,0.0,17.0
users get physical token which automatically generates code which stays active for 60 seconds,0.0,14.0
many companies use token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already,0.0,13.0
it is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with uk banks,0.0,12.0
steve ash from activcard told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification,0.0,18.0
the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online,0.0,19.0
the end solution is to provide method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both,0.0,22.0
the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for specified amount of time,1.0,31.0
this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes,0.0,20.0
it combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions,1.0,14.0
you take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and code is given,1.0,17.0
if you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction,0.0,20.0
the clever bit happens back at the bank secure servers,0.0,10.0
the code is validated by the bank systems matching the information they expect with the customer unique key,1.0,18.0
each individual gets key which is unique to them,0.0,9.0
it is 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack said mr ash,1.0,14.0
it means that in typical security attack explains mr ash even if password information is captured by scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode,1.0,30.0
by the time they go back to use the information the code has expired so they can prove who they are according to mr ash,1.0,25.0
in the next few years mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use,0.0,27.0
pcs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards,0.0,22.0
the gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants pdas and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them,0.0,21.0

third-generation mobile 3g networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services,0.0,23.0
that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week,0.0,19.0
fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association,1.0,23.0
at 3gsm siemens showed off system that transmits faster mobile data,1.0,11.0
the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit second up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks,1.0,21.0
the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access high-speed high bandwidth technology available now,1.0,34.0
early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second mbps compared with less than 384 kilobits per second kbps on standard 3g networks,0.0,24.0
high-speed downlink packet access hsdpa sometimes called super 3g will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys,1.0,32.0
number of companies are developing the technology,0.0,7.0
nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access,0.0,20.0
the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers,0.0,15.0
while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to maximum of 14mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements,0.0,41.0
the typical average user rate in real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity when compared to basic wcdma 3g he added,0.0,40.0
motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using single hsdpa device,1.0,28.0
but some mobile operators are opting for technology called evolution data optimised ev-do,1.0,13.0
us operator sprint ordered broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year,1.0,17.0
we are expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprint vice president for technology development when the contract was announced,0.0,31.0
as part of 3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around 1bn on ev-do technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits second and peak download rates of 2.4mbps,0.0,41.0
mmo2 the uk-based operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on the high speed downlink packet access hsdpa standard,1.0,26.0
using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps,1.0,30.0
us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson,0.0,18.0
siemens plans for one gigabit network may be more than user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015 the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by factor of 10,1.0,59.0
siemens in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one,1.0,37.0
this enables data transmission such as sending big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band,0.0,30.0
the speeds offered by3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences,1.0,19.0
but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dial-up phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits second must faster than 3g,0.0,31.0
this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up,0.0,15.0
if they aren those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators,0.0,33.0
but one gigabit second systems will not be available immediately,0.0,10.0
siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials,0.0,24.0
commercial system could be as far away as 2012 though siemens did not rule out an earlier date,0.0,18.0

apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named asteroid and has asked the journalists e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that,1.0,30.0

this undermines fundamental first amendment right that protects all reporters,0.0,10.0
if the court lets apple get away with this and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose vital outlet for independent news analysis and commentary he said,0.0,44.0

some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review all aspects of the directive,1.0,47.0
the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention,0.0,23.0

system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open back door for scammers trade body has warned,1.0,23.0
the internationalised domain names system has been work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet electronic task force,1.0,23.0
but the uk internet forum ukif is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily,1.0,19.0
the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language,0.0,11.0
registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become whole lot easier for determined scammers says stephen dyer director of ukif,1.0,37.0
domain names are the real language addresses of websites rather than their internet protocol address which is series of numbers,0.0,20.0
they are used so people can more easily navigate the web,0.0,11.0
so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages hybrid of system called unicode is used,1.0,20.0
so for example website paypal could now be coded using mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet,0.0,19.0
the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as russian look just like an english,1.0,22.0
but the computer code would be different and the site it would lead users to could be fake,1.0,18.0
this is more than just theory,0.0,6.0
fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name idn system said mr dyer,1.0,28.0
as the idea was to prove point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets worrying precedent mr dyer said,1.0,29.0
although the idn problem is well known in technical circles the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked said mr dyer,0.0,26.0
it is important to alert users that there is new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like perfectly genuine site he added,0.0,28.0
for instance browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as warning to users,0.0,20.0
mr dyer acknowledged that it would be huge undertaking to update all the world browsers,0.0,15.0
another solution to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be case of throwing out the baby with the bath water he said,0.0,20.0
centr the council of european national top level domain registries agrees,0.0,11.0

the chip also uses much less power than conventional chips said texas which means less strain on mobile battery life,1.0,20.0
more than 50 million people own mobile in the uk but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more,1.0,28.0
texas is keen to cash in on the third generation 3g of mobile technology which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions,1.0,25.0

if took random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it it wouldn work that well,0.0,20.0
mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to scientist who had never had any vision,1.0,34.0
as the notes increase in pitch know the colour getting redder and redder and in my mind eye patch of red appears,0.0,22.0

sporting rivals go to extra time,0.0,6.0
the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch,1.0,23.0
the two giants in the field espn and ea sports have been locked in heavyweight battle for years,1.0,18.0
the latter is the world largest games manufacturer,0.0,8.0
years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed massively entertaining and ooze flair,0.0,22.0
sports broadcaster espn meanwhile has leant its name to series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price,1.0,22.0
but that status quo was changed forever or for the next 15 years at least by deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on-air talent meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form,1.0,52.0
it was massive-money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters with fans concerned that it is set to enable ea to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree,0.0,36.0
"some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than 18,000 virtual signatures",0.0,16.0
many of those clicking to complain were already rankled for the espn coup happened just weeks after ea had pulled off another enormous licensing deal controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from america 191 national football league nfl,0.0,41.0
so will the sega espn range be missed,1.0,8.0
key reason for answering yes is that liking or disliking sports game regularly comes down to personal taste and having some options available always proves hugely handy,0.0,27.0
online soccer fans will testify to that between bouts of arguing over which high-profile title rules supreme out of the similar-yet-hugely-different fifa 2005 and pro evolution soccer,0.0,27.0
on the same note the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements,1.0,36.0
taking hockey and basketball as examples both publishers efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible,0.0,15.0
they also both look awesome with the sega espn versions perhaps shading things on graphical front,1.0,16.0
in terms of gameplay marginally preferred ea nba live 2005 for basketball and was more satisfied ice hockey-wise by espn nhl 2k5,0.0,22.0
the espn games are touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into although like their rivals they also offer dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans,1.0,49.0
perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea future titles,1.0,21.0
the front-end decoration of ea games has become something of an art-form in itself loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music,0.0,23.0
they are also immediately identifiable as coming from the ea stable and the inevitable compulsion to add an espn look will no doubt change that in various ways,0.0,28.0
what is shame is that the espn titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting their preambles look and sound much like they would on tv,0.0,30.0
they are neat and excellent-value games in their current form and combining them with ea own established brand should produce truly formidable beast,0.0,23.0

the allowances are extremely generous said mr ingram for what we are seeing in the market place they are really not an issue,0.0,23.0
bt will begin enforcing the allowances in the summer,0.0,9.0

batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer like video playback video messaging megapixel cameras and games amongst others,0.0,22.0
bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life,0.0,19.0
fifty percent of europeans said the size of mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets,0.0,30.0
mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready said thomas husson mobile analyst at jupiter research,1.0,30.0
mobile music services should be new and different and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches,0.0,21.0

mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though said the report,1.0,18.0

the service uses 3gp technology one of the standards for mobile tv,1.0,12.0
but at the end of 2004 the european telecommunications institute etsi formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld dvb-h as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe,1.0,26.0
operators will be working on the standard as way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles as well as trying to overcome several other barriers,0.0,24.0
the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed,0.0,15.0
handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard,0.0,12.0
tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too which expects good quality images at low prices according to analysts,1.0,27.0
people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens said gartner,1.0,16.0
digital video recorders like europe sky box and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch,1.0,21.0

"more than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses",0.0,27.0
some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases,0.0,23.0
the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low,1.0,13.0
the survey of consumers in the uk france germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini,0.0,19.0
the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology,0.0,20.0
the tags are combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by scanner each item contains unique identification number,0.0,21.0
more than half 55 of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases,1.0,27.0
fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties,1.0,23.0
ard jan vetham capgemini principal consultant on rfid said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology,1.0,28.0
acceptance of new technologies always has tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns,0.0,16.0
with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers the industry can reach this point,0.0,16.0
he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items,1.0,29.0
the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items,0.0,23.0

the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read search and share all the blogs they are interested in,0.0,27.0
ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web,1.0,28.0
how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed,1.0,10.0
bloglines has become popular because it lets users build list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually,0.0,25.0
to do this it makes use of technology known as really simple syndication rss that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals,0.0,32.0
the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites,0.0,9.0
google acquired pyra labs makers of the blogger software in 2003,0.0,11.0
in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do better job of handling blog entries,0.0,22.0
jim lanzone vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us said it did not acquire bloglines just to get foothold in the blog publishing world,1.0,28.0
he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it,1.0,23.0
the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers he said,0.0,14.0
mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up personal collection of useful links,1.0,29.0
search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites he said,0.0,26.0
it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates,1.0,17.0
there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines said mr lanzone,1.0,12.0
our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away he said,0.0,24.0
though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology,1.0,25.0
being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right said mr lanzone,0.0,22.0

nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mit media labs says he is developing laptop pc that will go on sale for less than 100 53,1.0,25.0
he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries,0.0,20.0
he said one laptop per child could be very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood,1.0,26.0
he said the child could use the laptop like text book,1.0,11.0
he described the device as stripped down laptop which would run linux-based operating system we have to get the display down to below 20 to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel,0.0,41.0
the second trick is to get rid of the fat if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory,0.0,30.0
the device will probably be exported as kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down,0.0,18.0
mr negroponte said this was not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money,0.0,22.0
in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age,0.0,17.0
the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on,1.0,26.0
while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken,0.0,24.0
however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops,1.0,28.0
we put in 25 laptops three years ago only one has been broken the kids cherish these things it also tv telephone and games machine not just textbook,0.0,28.0
mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious,1.0,17.0
nokia make 200 million cell phones year so for us to claim we re going to make 200 million laptops is big number but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years we re talking about months,1.0,41.0

looks and music to drive mobiles,0.0,6.0
mobile phones are still enjoying boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner,0.0,16.0
more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date,0.0,19.0
the figure was 30 more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said,0.0,17.0
good design and the look of mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005 said analysts,1.0,28.0
although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing slow-down in replacement sales,0.0,24.0
all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website,0.0,26.0
japan is where north america and western european markets can be in couple of years time,0.0,16.0
they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones,0.0,23.0
but there could be slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology,1.0,28.0
this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see compelling reason to upgrade said gartner,1.0,26.0
third generation mobiles 3g with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen,1.0,37.0
at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don really care about technology the speed of data to phone is not critical,0.0,37.0
nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own,1.0,22.0
the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms,0.0,24.0
more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services,1.0,20.0
the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005 she added,0.0,21.0
this was not women thing she said but desire from men and women to have gadget that is form of self-expression too,0.0,22.0
it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner,1.0,17.0
western europe has always been market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi,0.0,15.0
people are after something that is nice-looking and together with that there is the entertainment side,0.0,16.0
this year music will have part to play in this,0.0,10.0
the market for full-track music downloads was worth just 20 million 10.5 million in 2004 but is set to be worth 1.8 billion 9.4 million by 2009 according to jupiter research,0.0,31.0
sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the w800 which combines digital music player with up to 30 hours battery life and two megapixel camera,1.0,27.0
in july last year motorola and apple announced version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones,1.0,26.0
apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola standard music application for its music phones,1.0,17.0
but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod,1.0,24.0
ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives,1.0,16.0
but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life,0.0,31.0

the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into form that can be read by the handheld e-slates,1.0,23.0
it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it,0.0,24.0
it also stores this on its hard disc,0.0,8.0
the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network,0.0,15.0
but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project,1.0,13.0
it very simple to set up just satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it also one-way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult,1.0,31.0
the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux-based system,0.0,24.0
the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions,0.0,11.0
users can scroll through these sections independently of each other,0.0,10.0
eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content,1.0,17.0
mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students,0.0,13.0
he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world largest university libraries,0.0,25.0
all books in the public domain something like 15 million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them,0.0,21.0
then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity,1.0,33.0
but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions,1.0,15.0
we plan to put solar panel at the school with the base station have the e-slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working,1.0,37.0
maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the e-slates says the project ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world,0.0,23.0
why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks,0.0,18.0
the fact that we are doing this in rural developing country is very exciting as they need it most,0.0,19.0
firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks,1.0,22.0
the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services,1.0,29.0
the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work,0.0,22.0
the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones,0.0,20.0
in the last couple of years ringtones wallpapers screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular,0.0,20.0
but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers said jeremy flynn head of third party services at vodafone,1.0,27.0
if you are not on the operator portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it problem of how people discover your services he said,0.0,28.0
to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers,0.0,21.0
this tactic involved signing people up for subscription to give them for instance several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting,0.0,29.0
mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of few weeks at the end of 2004,1.0,21.0
websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for,0.0,27.0
what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently said mr flynn,1.0,16.0
people did not know they were being offered subscription service,0.0,10.0
we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here he added,0.0,10.0
the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones,1.0,25.0
the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk phone firms,0.0,18.0
everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct said andrew bud regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox,0.0,25.0
it all about transparency he said,1.0,6.0
consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it,0.0,18.0
the consumer has right to be protected he said,1.0,9.0
christian harris partnership manager of mobile content firm zed said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads,1.0,27.0
the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out he said,0.0,23.0
the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them,0.0,27.0
some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for said mr flynn,1.0,26.0
also said mr flynn vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules,1.0,18.0
we have quite draconian contracts with firms he said,0.0,9.0
we do not have to say why,0.0,7.0
we can just cut them off,0.0,6.0
under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using universal stop command sent via text message,0.0,21.0
he said the system had been designed to limit how much consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for service,1.0,21.0
the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality said mr flynn,1.0,22.0
creator of first apple mac dies,0.0,6.0
jef raskin head of the team behind the first macintosh computer has died,1.0,13.0
mr raskin was one of the first employees at apple and made many of the design decisions that made the mac so distinctive when it was first released,1.0,28.0
he led the team that decided to use graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking,0.0,23.0
the 1984 release of the mac reflected mr raskin belief that good design should make computers easy to use,0.0,19.0
mr raskin joined apple in 1978 as employee number 31 initially to lead the company publications department,0.0,17.0
however in 1979 he was put in charge of small team to design computer that lived up to his idea of machine that was cheap aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use,1.0,38.0
the result was the 1984 macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled virtual desktop and used folders and documents,0.0,31.0
users navigated around the machine using mouse and by pointing clicking and dragging,0.0,13.0
although now in common use in almost all computers these methods were pioneering when first used in the macintosh,0.0,19.0
the gui was developed by xerox parc and used in its star machine,0.0,13.0
but the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by apple in its pioneering lisa computer,1.0,24.0
his role on the macintosh was the initiator of the project so it wouldn be here if it weren for him said andy hertzfeld an early macintosh team member,0.0,29.0
although mr raskin drove the team that created the macintosh he did not stay at apple to see it released,1.0,20.0
in 1981 he was removed from the project following dispute with apple mercurial boss steve jobs,0.0,16.0
in 1982 mr raskin left apple entirely,1.0,7.0
the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskin favourite apple though the name was changed slightly following trademark dispute with another company,1.0,22.0
after leaving apple mr raskin founded another company called information appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers,0.0,22.0

people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends,1.0,25.0
more than 50 of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years,1.0,20.0
more than half 54 of those asked in poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book,1.0,22.0
about 80 of uk adults own at least one mobile according to official figures,0.0,14.0
it is estimated that 53 of over 65s own mobile according to intervoice but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34,0.0,25.0
most 15 to 24-year-olds 94 and 25 to 34-year-olds 92 own at least one,0.0,14.0
nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts information again if the phone was lost stolen or replaced,1.0,28.0
the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book,1.0,17.0
many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details and with people changing their phones once year on average it becomes problem,1.0,26.0
they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart relying on the mobile phone book instead,1.0,18.0
we re nation of lazy so-and-sos david noone from intervoice said,0.0,11.0
we put the numbers in our phones so we can call friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book,0.0,37.0
the mobile phone plays such key role in modern relationships take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart,1.0,23.0
one in three women the survey said thought if they lost their phones it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether,0.0,23.0
most 62 said they had no idea what their partner number was,0.0,12.0
mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves,1.0,28.0
generally information from sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is smartphone model with the right software,0.0,31.0

pvrs record tv programmes to hard drive letting viewers pause and rewind live television and effectively time shift the viewing experience,0.0,21.0
number of pvrs incorporating freeview digital terrestrial tv are also on the market but their success is limited,0.0,18.0
telewest pvr will offer 160gb hard drive which has storage for up to 80 hours of programmes,1.0,17.0
the box has three tuners which means viewers can record two channels simultaneously while watching third channel,0.0,17.0
sky plus boxes come in two versions 20gb version for 99 and 160gb version for 399,0.0,16.0
sky also charges 10 subscription fee to the service unless viewers have subscription to one of its premium packages,0.0,19.0
telewest has yet to reveal pricing for the new box or if it will be charging subscription fee for the service,1.0,21.0
eric tveter president and chief operating officer at telewest broadband said we will make our pvr set-top box available later this year putting stop to missed soaps interrupted films and arguments over which programmes to record,0.0,36.0

video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom,1.0,18.0
with violent titles continuing to top the charts gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn,0.0,25.0
recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have valid place in the classroom,0.0,17.0
games teach life skills such as decision making problem solving said martin owen at futurelab,0.0,15.0
mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error,1.0,19.0
futurelab is non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning,0.0,13.0
most game firms are too busy turning profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but liverpool-based games firm lateral visions saw gap in the market,1.0,32.0
learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn see anyone else doing what we wanted to do said dr carl gavin managing director of lateral visions,0.0,26.0
the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of commercial game but with an educational and learning element,1.0,24.0
the result is racing academy massively multiplayer car racing game which requires not only thirst for speed but working knowledge of physics and engineering as well,0.0,26.0
it is being used by futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom,0.0,16.0
we are keen to find out whether alongside learning game we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational said mr owen,1.0,29.0
players will have to understand how car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in way that no text book can teach,0.0,37.0
the game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from variety of outputs before and after racing,0.0,26.0
teamwork is essential and chat area allows students to exchange information and data work collaboratively and review their own performances,0.0,20.0
this fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved thinks mr owen,0.0,30.0
the game has been trialled in two secondary schools in bristol and feedback from students has been positive,0.0,18.0
pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other said ben williamson researcher at futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools,1.0,40.0
dr gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers need for learning outcomes and the children desire to rise to challenge,0.0,20.0
games in the classroom need to support the teacher,0.0,9.0
it is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer challenge he said,1.0,22.0
professor angela macfarlane based at bristol university has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms,0.0,19.0
use of games in schools has been patchy she found with sim city proving the most popular,0.0,17.0
traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in belief that such packages help to make learning fun she found in her research,1.0,28.0
it is perhaps in compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies she wrote in paper entitled games and learning,1.0,27.0
lite versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles persuading developers to write for the educational market,1.0,26.0
this would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering new opportunity for marketing,0.0,22.0
already there are games on the market such as civilisation and age of empire that have educational elements said mr owen,1.0,21.0
even in grand theft auto it is not just the violence that engages people he said,0.0,16.0
it could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though,1.0,15.0

at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment,1.0,23.0
ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel apple and ibm among others to promote recycling,0.0,17.0
the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11 in 2005,1.0,14.0
but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient said the us environmental protection agency epa,1.0,30.0
of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices one of the fastest growing markets in technology,0.0,22.0

the initiative which was also launched at ces rewards 10 to 28-year-olds for returning unused phones,0.0,16.0
this system allows for the transformation of drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games said seth heine from ripmobile,0.0,28.0
"one group of students collected 1,000 mobiles for recycling in just three months",0.0,13.0
mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes learned behaviour,1.0,24.0
europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the us in terms of recycling awareness and robust end of life programmes although there is tide change happening in the rest of the world too,0.0,32.0
intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at ces which are entirely lead free,0.0,14.0
there is more and more awareness on the consumer side but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free intel allen wilson told the bbc news website,1.0,28.0
there is still low-level awareness right now but it is on the rise the highest level of awareness is in europe,0.0,21.0
european union eu directive weee waste electronic and electrical equipment comes into effect in august,0.0,15.0
it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them,0.0,15.0
but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances,1.0,22.0
elements like chromium lead and cadmium common in consumer electronics goods will be prohibited in all products in the eu by 2006,1.0,22.0
but it is not just about recycling either,0.0,8.0
the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too,1.0,23.0
the biggest culprit according to the epa is the innocuous power adaptor nicknamed energy vampires,1.0,15.0
they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones pdas personal digital assistants digital cameras camcorders and digital music players,0.0,20.0
although there is focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power gadget,1.0,33.0
on january new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct,0.0,21.0
but at ces the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters,1.0,20.0
these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo meaning they are about 35 more efficient,0.0,25.0
the initiative is global effort and more manufacturers adaptors are being brought on board,0.0,14.0
about two billion are shipped global every year and about three billion are in use in the us alone,1.0,19.0
the epa is already working with several companies which make more than 22 of power supplies on the market,1.0,19.0
we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat hi-tech devices but also bundle with it hi-tech efficient power supply the epa andrew fanara said,1.0,28.0
initiatives like this are critical if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40 of electricity used in us homes said the epa,1.0,40.0
evil twin fear for wireless net,0.0,6.0
people using wireless high-speed net wi-fi are being warned about fake hotspots or access points,1.0,15.0
the latest threat nicknamed evil twins pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations say cranfield university experts,0.0,20.0
once logged onto an evil twin sensitive data can be intercepted,0.0,11.0
wi-fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability,1.0,11.0
"london leads the global wi-fi hotspots league with more than 1,000",1.0,11.0
"the number of hotspots is expected to reach 200,000 by 2008 according to analysts",0.0,14.0
users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of sensitive or personal nature said professor brian collins head of information systems at cranfield university,1.0,41.0
users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated he added,1.0,18.0
bt openzone which operates vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure,1.0,27.0
naturally people may have security concerns said chris clark chief executive for bt wireless broadband,1.0,15.0
but wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet like broadband or dial-up,0.0,21.0
he said bt openzone as well as others have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at hotspot,0.0,23.0
this means that users personal information and data logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure said mr clark,1.0,19.0
in the vast majority of cases base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible said dr nobles,0.0,29.0
cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam jam connections to legitimate base station by sending stronger signal near to the wireless client,0.0,25.0
anyone with the right gear can find real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin,0.0,16.0
cybercriminals don have to be that clever to carry out such an attack said dr phil nobles wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield,1.0,24.0
because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency,0.0,21.0
although wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move there have been fears over how secure it is,1.0,26.0
some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security,0.0,16.0
wireless network that is not protected can provide backdoor into company computer system,0.0,13.0
public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud are accessible after users sign up and pay for use,1.0,22.0
but many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be sniffed out and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment,0.0,23.0
bt advises that customers should change all default settings make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly said mr clark,0.0,24.0
we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data can not be intercepted,0.0,24.0

china to overtake us net use,0.0,6.0
the chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years says report,0.0,19.0
china net users number 100m but this represents less than of the country 1.3 billion people,1.0,16.0
market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the 137 million us users of the net by 2008,1.0,21.0
the report says that the country culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations,1.0,25.0
already net use in china has very different character than in many western nations said william makower chief executive of panlogic,1.0,21.0
in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work,0.0,17.0
by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare,0.0,9.0
this combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china,0.0,32.0
only 36 of chinese homes have telephones according to reports,0.0,10.0
net usage tends to happen in the evening said mr makower they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf 233,0.0,27.0
its fundamentally different usage to what we have here he said,0.0,11.0
net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities,0.0,26.0
the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends said mr makower,1.0,16.0
many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes,1.0,19.0
what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life,1.0,15.0
for instance said mr makower credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt,1.0,22.0
the most popular way to pay is cash-on-delivery he said and that quite brake to the development of e-commerce,0.0,19.0
the arrival of foreign banks in china due in 2006 could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare said mr makower,1.0,27.0
but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living,0.0,32.0
large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar he said,0.0,17.0
generally it more difficult for the government to be able to control it,0.0,13.0
its real value is as an open window onto what happening elsewhere in the world he said,0.0,17.0
government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else,1.0,27.0
familiarity with the net also has certain social cachet,0.0,9.0
it sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it said mr makower,0.0,20.0

it should expand over time to include content from more channels said google spokesperson,0.0,14.0
the first version of the service is part of google expanding efforts to be ubiquitous search engine for people to find what they want on the web and beyond,0.0,29.0
we think tv is big part of people lives said jonathan rosenberg google vice president of product management,0.0,18.0
ultimately we would like to have all tv programming indexed,0.0,10.0

viruses trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing subtle change,0.0,19.0
the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash steal valuable data or take over home pcs,0.0,27.0
viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer,0.0,11.0
instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code,1.0,25.0
the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs,1.0,22.0
before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines,0.0,24.0
but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package,1.0,18.0
you can not put them in to the neat little box that you used to said pete simpson head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift,0.0,27.0
now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments,0.0,24.0
it about outright criminality now said mr simpson explaining why this change has come about,1.0,15.0
he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order,1.0,29.0
former virus writer marek strihavka aka benny from the 29a virus writing group recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers phishing gangs and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology,0.0,42.0
no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors,0.0,22.0
not least said paul king principal security consultant at cisco because the defences against such attacks are so common,0.0,19.0
in many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now he said,1.0,24.0
few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing program or handing over important data,1.0,38.0
if you think of criminals they do not do clever said mr king they just do what works,1.0,18.0
as the tactics used by malicious programs change said mr king so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves,1.0,21.0
now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network,0.0,22.0
many will not let machine connect and worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded,0.0,22.0
as well as using different tactics criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent,0.0,17.0
the main motivation now is money said gary stowell spokesman for st bernard software,0.0,14.0
mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high,0.0,27.0
with almost any phishing or spyware attack criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover,1.0,24.0
so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites,0.0,38.0
in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine,1.0,31.0

the survey conducted by the pew internet and american life project showed that blog readership has shot up by 58 in the last year,1.0,24.0

more and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as result of data misuse,0.0,15.0
sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the national hi-tech crime unit nhtcu survey conducted on its behalf by nop found evidence that more than 80 of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime,0.0,46.0
bridgehead software has come up with techniques to prove to legal standard that any stored file on pc has not been tampered with,1.0,23.0
ironically the impetus for developing the system came as result of the freedom of information act which requires companies to store all data for certain amount of time,1.0,28.0
the storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on computer to be logged,1.0,23.0

the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed,1.0,25.0
the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months,1.0,20.0
critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation,1.0,17.0
there was at one point the intention to put the item on today agenda,0.0,14.0
but in the end we could not put it on an eu spokesman told the reuters agency,0.0,17.0
he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law,0.0,14.0
in december poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software,1.0,26.0
its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting,0.0,26.0
poland is large eu member so its backing for the legislation is vital,0.0,13.0
the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters,1.0,30.0
in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted,0.0,14.0
this means that the us-based amazon.com holds patent for its one-click shopping service,0.0,13.0

savvy searchers fail to spot ads,0.0,6.0
internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests report into search habits,1.0,17.0
the report by the us pew research center reveals that 87 of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using search engine,1.0,24.0
it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones,0.0,15.0
the report reveals that 84 of net users say they regularly use google ask jeeves msn and yahoo when online,0.0,20.0
almost 50 of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden,1.0,25.0
according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt,0.0,30.0
significant chunk of net users 36 carry out search at least weekly and 29 of those asked only look every few weeks,0.0,22.0
for 44 of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find,0.0,26.0
search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it,0.0,25.0
according to pew research 44 of searchers use just single search engine 48 use two or three and small number consult more than three sites,0.0,25.0
tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query,1.0,38.0
despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes,1.0,20.0
small number 17 said they wouldn really miss search engines if they did not exist,1.0,15.0
the remaining 33 said they could not live without search sites,0.0,11.0
more than two-thirds of those questioned 68 said they thought that the results they were presented with were fair and unbiased selection of the information on topic that can be found on the net,0.0,34.0
alongside the growing sophistication of net users is lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web,1.0,28.0
of those asked 62 were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out search,0.0,22.0
only 18 of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not,0.0,18.0
said the pew report this finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results,1.0,35.0
commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference,0.0,31.0

that figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the bbc news website codemasters climax and rebellion,0.0,18.0
as consoles get more powerful the content gets more detailed and that means more cost said gary dunn development director at codemasters which develops games in house and also publishes titles,1.0,31.0
jason kingsley chief executive of rebellion said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger,1.0,33.0
he added we have been through five technology transitions and survived so far,0.0,13.0
each one has involved the death of some people,0.0,9.0

artgarden developed by bt research unit is being tested by the tate as new way of browsing its online collection of paintings,1.0,22.0
rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown selection of pictures,1.0,17.0
clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to selection of similar works,0.0,17.0
the technology uses system dubbed smart serendipity which is combination of artificial intelligence and random selection,1.0,16.0
it chooses selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on selection of keywords associated with them,1.0,16.0
so for instance whistler painting of bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement 19th century and water,0.0,37.0
variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck,0.0,19.0
it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery said jemima rellie head of the tate digital programme,0.0,19.0
for richard tateson who worked on the artgarden project the need for new way to search grew out of personal frustration,1.0,21.0
went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but didn have clue what wanted he said,0.0,23.0
the text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful,0.0,20.0
he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead,0.0,12.0
he thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers,0.0,17.0
similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding particular object,0.0,12.0
you don arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see,0.0,14.0
one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn have asked for he said,0.0,22.0
the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that said ms rellie,1.0,22.0
she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future,0.0,15.0

writing microsoft word document can be dangerous business according to document security firm workshare,1.0,14.0
up to 75 of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed survey by the firm revealed,1.0,21.0
to make matters worse 90 of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking,0.0,17.0
the report warns firms to do better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding,0.0,17.0
sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers said andrew pearson european boss of workshare which commissioned the research,1.0,36.0
the efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too he said,0.0,23.0
the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes,1.0,22.0
as documents get passed around worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents,1.0,21.0
poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits,0.0,19.0
microsoft however does provide an add-on tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem,0.0,14.0
the remove hidden data add-in is tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your microsoft office application says the instructions on microsoft website,0.0,39.0
microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any word document,1.0,13.0
tool for apple machines running word is not available,0.0,9.0
workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that on average 31 of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category,1.0,32.0
often said mr pearson this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared,0.0,20.0
however the way that windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how document has evolved,0.0,24.0
few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed,1.0,26.0
the discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if for instance those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of deal being negotiated,0.0,29.0
the research revealed that document metadata could be substantial as on average only 40 of contributors changes to document make it to the final draft,0.0,25.0
problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite said mr pearson,0.0,23.0
the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog ofcom has said,1.0,17.0

despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option,1.0,32.0
at the debate organised by the internet service providers association ispa lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation,1.0,21.0
the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves he said,0.0,34.0
adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or self-regulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion,1.0,26.0
some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005 and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net,1.0,35.0
more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web,1.0,16.0

head of the division andrew burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms,0.0,16.0
how risque can be in this new age,0.0,8.0
with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely can push it to the limit he said,0.0,19.0
in fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free,1.0,28.0
internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them mere conduits back in 2002,0.0,27.0
this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it,0.0,19.0
the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases,0.0,14.0
richard ayers portal director at tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible,0.0,21.0
huge changes are afoot in 2005 he predicted as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net,1.0,20.0
the bbc planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise whole new set of questions he said,0.0,35.0
one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such huge quantity of data and could herald new digital licence fee said mr ayers,0.0,33.0
as inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains political issue said mp richard allan liberal democrat spokesman on it,1.0,29.0
mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of impossible to regulate and just apply offline laws online,0.0,22.0
in fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content,1.0,24.0
after lord currie departed the panel agreed that this could be reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign,0.0,23.0
if content is on-demand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers choice to watch it,0.0,24.0
there is no watershed on the net said mr burke,1.0,10.0

net browser opera 8.0 due for official release at the end of next month will be the most accessible browser on the market according to its authors,0.0,27.0
the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud,1.0,18.0
the voice features based on ibm technology are currently only available in the windows version,1.0,15.0
opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create style sheets its developers say,0.0,19.0
this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer,0.0,14.0
but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision,1.0,32.0
our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone said opera spokeswoman berit hanson,1.0,17.0
so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users,0.0,11.0
another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling,0.0,28.0
the company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with handheld device,0.0,16.0
the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people,1.0,16.0
our idea was to take first step in making human-computer interaction more natural said ms hanson,0.0,16.0
people are not always in situation where they can access keyboard so this makes the web more hands-free experience,0.0,19.0
unlike commercially available voice recognition software opera does not have to be trained to recognise an individual voice,1.0,18.0
around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear headset which incorporates microphone,1.0,16.0
the voice recognition function is currently only available in english,1.0,10.0
opera is free to download but paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support,0.0,23.0
opera began life as research project spin-off from norwegian telecoms company telenor,0.0,12.0
its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on variety of operating systems and number of different platforms,0.0,20.0
web radio takes spanish rap global,0.0,6.0
spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music,0.0,17.0
but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop,1.0,10.0
hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad,1.0,21.0
but now us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere,1.0,15.0
los caballeros de plan are one of mexico hottest hip-hop acts,1.0,11.0
they have devoted fan base in their native monterrey,0.0,9.0
but most mexican hip-hop fans not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world rarely get chance to hear the group tracks on the radio,1.0,26.0
you can really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish it just not accessible says manuel millan native of san diego california,1.0,26.0
it really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio,1.0,13.0
you usually have very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world,0.0,20.0
millan and two friends set out to change that they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan accessible to fans globally,1.0,23.0
mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible,0.0,21.0
so millan and his friends launched website called latinohiphopradio.com,0.0,9.0
the name says it all it is web-based radio devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks,1.0,19.0
the site which is in both in english and spanish is meant to be easy to navigate,0.0,17.0
all the user has to do is download media player,0.0,10.0
it is just music streamed over the net for free,0.0,10.0
suddenly with the help of the website los caballeros de plan are producing export quality rap,0.0,16.0
the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now,1.0,14.0
the genre is in what millan calls its infant stage,0.0,10.0
but the production values are improving and artists such as argentina mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better,0.0,21.0
mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com,1.0,11.0
he considered the eminem of argentina and the latin american hip-hop scene millan says,1.0,14.0
he really hasn had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but he definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world,0.0,35.0
currently the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com top 10 as is cuban artist papo record,0.0,17.0
every country got it own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs millan says,0.0,19.0
latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for couple of months now,0.0,11.0
the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world,1.0,10.0
right now mexico leads the way accounting for about 50 of listeners,0.0,12.0
but web surfers in spain are logging in as well about 25 of the web station traffic comes from there,0.0,20.0
that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop,1.0,17.0
millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production,1.0,21.0
that might be changing though as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences,0.0,15.0
but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com top 10,0.0,10.0
his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain,1.0,17.0
on his track uno contra veinte emcees or one against 20 emcees tote king shows he is well aware of that fact,0.0,22.0
it basically him bragging that he one of the best emcees in spain right now millan says,1.0,17.0
he has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable it amazing,0.0,13.0
latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year,0.0,9.0
millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip-hop and rap,1.0,20.0

the body that represents the us movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie file-sharing aimed at parents,1.0,25.0
the movie association for america mpaa free parent file scan software lets parents check their children computers for peer-to-peer programs,1.0,20.0
it will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive,1.0,15.0
parents then have the choice to remove programs and files,0.0,10.0
the mpaa said files found would not be passed on to it,1.0,12.0
our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files said dan glickman mpaa chief,0.0,29.0
many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where they ve downloaded it from,0.0,17.0
but some computer users who had tested the latest software reported on some technology sites that the program had identified windows default wav files as copyrighted material and wanted to delete them,0.0,32.0
movie piracy cost the industry 3.7bn 7bn in 2003 according to analysts,0.0,12.0
the mpaa said in statement that it would continue to provide easy access to similar tools in the coming months to combat the deleterious effects of peer-to-peer software including such common problems as viruses trojan horses and identity theft,0.0,39.0
mr glickman said that the film industry was embracing digital age technologies like movielink and cinemanow which are legal movie sites,1.0,21.0
but legal services such as these need chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive he added,0.0,28.0
the industry body also said it had launched second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the us but did not say how many were being sued,1.0,28.0
its first set of lawsuits were filed in november 2004,0.0,10.0
it also started campaign against operators of bittorrent edonkey and directconnect peer-to-peer networks,0.0,13.0

norwegian student who ran website which linked to downloadable mp3 files has been ordered to pay compensation by the country supreme court,0.0,22.0
"frank allan bruvik was ordered to pay 100,000 kroner 8,000 to the music industry in norway",1.0,16.0
he was student when he set up his napster.no site which allowed users to submit and receive links to mp3 files,0.0,21.0
bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after lower court had found for the music industry,1.0,16.0
music industry bosses in norway said the ruling would help build confidence in the internet as distribution medium,0.0,18.0
frank allan bruvik set up the napster.no website as part of school project in 2001 while studying computer engineering in the norwegian town of lillehammer,0.0,25.0
the website was not associated with the napster.com site in the usa which had been operating since 1999 and was already facing legal action,0.0,24.0
bruvik site was online between august and november 2001 and while it did not host any music at its peak it was providing links to more than 170 free files on other servers,1.0,33.0
as well as providing links the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors,0.0,22.0
legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including norway performing rights society tono and the norwegian branches of sony music and universal music who saw it as an important test of principle,1.0,34.0
"norwegian court ruled in 2003 that bruvik would have to pay 100,000 kroner to the music industry but the country court of appeal cleared him saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music",1.0,36.0
however the supreme court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law it added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act and that bruvik actions were premeditated,1.0,38.0
norway music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling because showed that music piracy would not be accepted,1.0,19.0

the relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors particularly among mobile phone firms all suggests that 2005 is going to be very good year,0.0,33.0
to begin with 2005 will be the year that third-generation 3g mobile phones become inescapable,1.0,15.0
the network launched in 2003 vodafone launched its consumer service in november orange followed in early december and t-mobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005,0.0,27.0
the main result of these launches will likely be slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up,0.0,31.0
already the extra capacity in 3g networks lets offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators,1.0,27.0
but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose significant chunk of their revenue,1.0,20.0
show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them and ll write their obituary said niel ransom chief technology officer at alcatel,0.0,25.0
instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities,1.0,22.0
already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale,1.0,22.0
but 3g will not have everything its own way,0.0,9.0
it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax,1.0,10.0
this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles,0.0,23.0
kent is likely to be the site of the uk first wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access,1.0,34.0
analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal lot of market share from 3g and will be clear winner,0.0,20.0
bob larribeau principal analyst at telecom view said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of 3g networks,0.0,27.0
and the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either,0.0,11.0
the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers,0.0,26.0
moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too,1.0,16.0
for start bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next 12 months,0.0,16.0
the service revolves around hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home,1.0,29.0
fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip voip,1.0,24.0
voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network,1.0,13.0
anyone with broadband connection which is now more than 50 of the uk net using population can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it,0.0,30.0
telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for voip calls and 2005 is likely to see lot more consumer-focused voip call services starting up,1.0,28.0
home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition,0.0,22.0
if 2004 has been the year of the portable music player they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player,0.0,25.0
motorola has just announced deal with apple to produce phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace,1.0,32.0
the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet,0.0,19.0
some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had,0.0,22.0
convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number,0.0,11.0
instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want,0.0,17.0
the only downside is that consumers will face series of tough choices as they are confronted by bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities,0.0,33.0
but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with,0.0,13.0
what high-definition will do to dvds,0.0,6.0
first it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment high-definition,1.0,25.0
high-definition gives incredible 3d-like pictures and surround sound,0.0,8.0
the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still number of issues to be sorted out,0.0,30.0
but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment,1.0,18.0
for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx high-definition future is an exciting prospect,0.0,18.0
he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones,0.0,16.0
there was time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website,0.0,26.0
the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined,0.0,13.0
the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says,1.0,23.0
but currently putting master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology can not hold as much as high-definition films demand,1.0,24.0
as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains,0.0,30.0
would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and find it very exciting,0.0,26.0
high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to,1.0,17.0
it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months time,1.0,30.0
mr dean is confident though think if they see real hd high-definition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such remarkable difference,1.0,24.0
have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen,0.0,13.0
high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too,1.0,12.0
on the whole producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed,1.0,19.0
equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd,1.0,16.0
when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second says mr dean,1.0,20.0
our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second,0.0,20.0
that huge amount of compression that has to be applied about 98,0.0,12.0
so if you have anything that allows more space you don have to compress so hard,0.0,16.0
studios could fit lot more marketing material games and features onto high-capacity dvds,0.0,13.0
currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean,1.0,14.0
although the step of down-converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save day work says mr dean,0.0,18.0
one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems,0.0,14.0
on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone,0.0,18.0
if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay,1.0,22.0
if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required,0.0,33.0
and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it,1.0,26.0
those costs could filter down to the price ticket on high-definition dvd,1.0,12.0
but if the consumer is not willing to pay premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean,0.0,17.0
high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike,1.0,12.0
more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous,0.0,18.0
when we did the first hd version of star wars episode everybody was very sun-tanned but that was make-up,0.0,19.0
in the hd version of episode all these make-up lines showed up explains mr dean,1.0,15.0
the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too,0.0,13.0
there are scans of corridor on the death star and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways,0.0,27.0
you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn see it,0.0,24.0
what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur,1.0,17.0
with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further,0.0,14.0
it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen,0.0,15.0
in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol broadband giving dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive says mr dean,0.0,30.0
but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves,0.0,22.0
the bbc news website takes look at how games on mobile phones are maturing,1.0,14.0
brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below,0.0,17.0
if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for bit of surprise,0.0,19.0
this is because mobile games have come long way in very short time,1.0,13.0
even before nokia n-gage game phone launched in late 2003 many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset,1.0,28.0
and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be very lucrative market,0.0,24.0
that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can,1.0,33.0

there are shoot-em-ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets,1.0,15.0
rarely now does an action movie launch without mobile game tie-in,1.0,11.0
increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for film understandable when you realise that good game can rack up millions of downloads,0.0,25.0
the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost,1.0,13.0
what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push,1.0,29.0
by sending text message to game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset,1.0,16.0
far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals,0.0,14.0
the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too,1.0,12.0
almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available even the ones that use 3d graphics,1.0,28.0
the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too,1.0,19.0
now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing real option,0.0,16.0
the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too,1.0,21.0
some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in mobile,1.0,15.0
many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others,0.0,18.0
usually you can get hold of their best time and race against ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them,0.0,22.0

mobiles rack up 20 years of use,0.0,7.0
mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend,1.0,12.0
britain first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise,1.0,19.0
in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own handset,1.0,25.0
mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use landline,0.0,19.0
the first ever call over portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched,1.0,28.0
the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked,1.0,25.0
the first call was made from st katherine dock to vodafone head office in newbury which at the time was over curry house,0.0,23.0
for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with mobile network in the uk,1.0,18.0
then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service,0.0,10.0
"mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of briefcase cost about 2,000 and had battery life of little more than 20 minutes",1.0,30.0
despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s he said,0.0,11.0
they became yuppy must-have and status symbol among young wealthy business folk,0.0,12.0
this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on,1.0,23.0
he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million,0.0,24.0
it very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said,0.0,29.0
now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone,1.0,9.0
cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now t-mobile was launched,1.0,20.0
orange had its uk launch in 1994,0.0,7.0
both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology,0.0,13.0
the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired,0.0,10.0
called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls,0.0,30.0
mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular,0.0,27.0
web logs or blogs are everywhere with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow,1.0,23.0
these online diaries come in many shapes and styles ranging from people willing to sharing their views pictures and links to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers,0.0,30.0
but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast critical eye over news events often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events,1.0,32.0
most blogs may have only small readership but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have say in the world of politics,1.0,26.0
the most well-known examples include iraqi salam pax accounts of the us-led war former iranian vice-president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic government and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign,0.0,37.0

the blogging movement has been building up for many years,0.0,10.0
andrew nachison director of the media center us-based think-tank that studies media technology and society highlights the us presidential race as possible turning point for blogs,0.0,26.0
you could look at that as moment when audiences exercised new form of power to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before he says,0.0,30.0
and blogs were key part of that transformation,1.0,8.0
among them were blogs carrying picture messages saying we are sorry for george bush victory and the responses from his supporters,0.0,21.0
mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers tv and radio,1.0,26.0
we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases mainstream media actually plays role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas he told the bbc news website,0.0,30.0
but they followed the story they didn lead it,0.0,9.0
some parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs,0.0,22.0
others like the french newspaper le monde have applied different strategy offering blogs as part of its content,1.0,18.0
don think the mission and role of journalism is threatened,0.0,10.0
it is in transition as society itself is in transition says mr nachison,1.0,13.0
however he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper,1.0,25.0
the one-to-many road of traditional journalism yes it is threatened,0.0,10.0
and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse says mr nachison,1.0,23.0
the notion of gatekeeper who filters and decides what acceptable for public consumption and what isn that gone forever,0.0,19.0
with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets like camera or video phones we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories,0.0,28.0
it seems unlikely that we will end up living in planet where every human is blogger,0.0,16.0
but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing in web already overloaded with information,1.0,18.0
blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence the so-called blogosphere has already exceeded five million and is growing at exponential levels,1.0,25.0
tools such as google blogger movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run blog,1.0,22.0
us research think-tank pew internet american life says blog is created every 5.8 seconds although less than 40 of the total are updated at least once every two months,1.0,29.0
but experts agree that the phenomenon allowing individuals to publish share ideas exchange information comment on current issues post images or video on the web easily is here to stay,0.0,30.0
we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other said mr nachison,0.0,30.0
and there going to be bad that comes with the good,0.0,11.0

the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us,1.0,16.0
some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site,0.0,13.0
the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers,0.0,23.0
geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on regional basis,0.0,20.0
on 21 october the george bush website began using the services of company called akamai to ensure that the pages videos and other content on its site reaches visitors,1.0,29.0
mike prettejohn president of netcraft speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run-up to the election on november,0.0,27.0
he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week,0.0,20.0
managing traffic could also be good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign,0.0,22.0

spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online all can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media,0.0,23.0
she added she could not say whether similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past,0.0,17.0
ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mother death,1.0,16.0
she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for and created fictional names for cities and companies,0.0,21.0
the airline name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville,1.0,19.0
large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as character in her own right according to ms simonetti,1.0,27.0

we often take pictures on flight or on layovers,0.0,9.0

of the 10 or so images on the site only one showed ms simonetti flight wings,0.0,16.0

jeffrey matsuura director of the law and technology programme at the university of dayton said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees,0.0,26.0
there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers he said,0.0,24.0
it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly was reasonable and enforced fairly in company policy,1.0,25.0
you have to remember that as an employee you don have total free speech anymore he said,0.0,17.0
mr matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog,0.0,11.0
one of the areas where it does become problem is that they encourage this when it suits them but they may not be particularly clear when they employees do cross the line,0.0,32.0
he speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of ms simonetti in uniform were posted,1.0,31.0
whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line he said,0.0,27.0
ms simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs,1.0,15.0
one of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken,1.0,16.0
if they had asked me just take down the blog would have done it but that was not been given to me as an option she said,1.0,27.0
this blogging thing is obviously new problem for employers and they need to get policy about it,0.0,17.0

the computer systems used to monitor the world nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors,1.0,22.0
spokesman for the international atomic energy agency iaea said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old,1.0,27.0
such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide,1.0,11.0
the agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software,0.0,13.0
major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate secure online access to information said project manager livio costantini,1.0,21.0
"iaea inspectors make around 3,000 visits year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide",1.0,14.0
they are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants to carry out environmental checks and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility,0.0,36.0
the computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits for instance was built in the 1970s and largely paper based,0.0,23.0
an iaea spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for needle in haystack,1.0,19.0
the organisation is aiming to start system upgrade in november aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data design blueprints of nuclear facilities even satellite images of the plant,1.0,36.0
where possible it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials,0.0,19.0
further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries according to spokesman,0.0,19.0

by the end of 2004 microsoft aims to launch search software to find any kind of file on pc hard drive,1.0,21.0
the move is in answer to google release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop pcs,0.0,19.0
the desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as google aol yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files,1.0,23.0
microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results,1.0,21.0
john connors microsoft chief financial officer said test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year,1.0,25.0
we re going to have heck of great race in search between google microsoft and yahoo he said,1.0,18.0
it going to be really fun to follow,0.0,8.0
microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from large number of rivals many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users,1.0,33.0
the program could be based on the software microsoft owns as result of its purchase of lookout software in early october,0.0,21.0
on 14 october google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on pc and lets users use one tool to find e-mail messages spreadsheets text files and presentations,1.0,30.0

it is called podcasting and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj video jockey adam curry,1.0,18.0
podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to podcast,1.0,23.0
podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create usually in the comfort of their own home,1.0,18.0

security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs,0.0,17.0
the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range,1.0,26.0
the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series 60 phone operating system,1.0,15.0
despite the warnings there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir,1.0,20.0
the original cabir worm came to light in mid-june 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as proof-of-concept program,0.0,20.0
mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at time,1.0,31.0
however the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range,1.0,23.0
bluetooth has an effective range of few tens of metres,0.0,10.0
the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it,0.0,29.0
users can protect themselves by altering setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices,0.0,19.0
finnish security firm f-secure issued warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to phone,1.0,24.0
all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone battery,0.0,13.0
anti-virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created,0.0,30.0
so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november,0.0,25.0

anti-virus firms are issuing high-level warnings about the new version of the bagle e-mail program that seems to be catching lot of people out,0.0,24.0
the windows virus grabs e-mail addresses from microsoft outlook and uses its own mail sending software to spread itself to new victims,1.0,22.0
when it infects machine the bagle variant turns off security measures that usually protect pcs,0.0,15.0
the new variant is called bagle.at bagle.bb and bagle.au and the attachment bearing the virus code is labelled as either joke or price,1.0,23.0
the body of the virus usually contains nothing but smiley or emoticon,0.0,12.0
the virus can strike computers running windows 95 98 me nt 2000 and xp,1.0,14.0
users will be infected if they open the attachment that travels with the e-mail,0.0,14.0
as well as plundering microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses to send itself to bagle.at also tries to turn off the firewall and security centre services on windows xp machines,1.0,29.0
bbc news online has received five warnings about the virus from security companies,1.0,13.0
finnish company f-secure gave the virus its second highest threat level,0.0,11.0
we ve had several reports all over the world said mikko hypponen director of anti-virus research for f-secure,0.0,18.0
"security firm network box said that it stopped more than 30,000 copies an hour of the virus as the outbreak reached peak",1.0,22.0
black spider said it had stopped more than million copies of bagle.at since the outbreak began at 0630 bst 0530 gmt,0.0,21.0

by early 2005 the net could have two new domain names,1.0,11.0
the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net administrative body,1.0,16.0
the names are just two of total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann,1.0,25.0
the other proposed names include domain for pornography asia mobile phones an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture,1.0,22.0
the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices,0.0,36.0
the .travel domain would be used by hotels travel firms airlines tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online,0.0,21.0
it is backed by new york-based trade group called the travel partnership,0.0,12.0
icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted,1.0,26.0
despite this initial approval icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service,1.0,19.0
at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains,0.0,12.0
one that may not win approval is proposal to set up .xxx domain for pornographic websites,0.0,16.0
similar proposal has been made many times in the past,0.0,10.0
but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it,0.0,20.0
in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success,1.0,15.0
three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero,0.0,19.0
others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic,0.0,12.0
in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations,1.0,18.0

robots are learning lessons on robotiquette how to behave socially so they can mix better with humans,0.0,17.0
by playing games like pass-the-parcel university of hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations,1.0,21.0
the study findings will eventually help humans develop code of social behaviour in human-robot interaction,0.0,15.0
the work is part of the european cogniron robotics project and was on show at london science museum,0.0,18.0
we are assuming situation in which useful human companion robot already exists said professor kerstin dautenhahn project leader at hertfordshire,1.0,20.0
our mission is to look at how such robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans,0.0,18.0
the research also focuses on human perception of robots including how they should look and how robot can learn new skills by imitating human demonstrator,1.0,25.0
without such studies you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds professor dautenhahn told bbc news online,1.0,31.0
and want robots to treat humans as human beings and not like other robots she added,1.0,16.0
in most situations companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person but also with groups of people,0.0,21.0
to find out how they would react the hertfordshire cogniron team taught one robot to play pass-the-parcel with children,0.0,19.0
showing off its skills at the science museum the unnamed robot had to select approach and ask different children to pick up parcel with gift moving it arm as pointer and its camera as an eye,0.0,36.0

cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses security firm has warned,0.0,15.0
the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines,0.0,18.0
already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system,1.0,21.0
but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small,0.0,19.0
for many years the venerable ibm operating system known as os has been the staple software used to power many of the 1.4m cash machines in operation around the world,0.0,30.0
but ibm will end support for os in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives,0.0,17.0
there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research,0.0,22.0
he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data,0.0,35.0
us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways,0.0,30.0
todd thiemann spokesman for anti-virus firm trend micro said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks,1.0,20.0
mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70 of new cash machines being installed were windows based,1.0,19.0
already he said there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them,1.0,29.0
"in january 2003 the slammer worm knocked out 13,000 cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce",1.0,28.0
in august of the same year cash machines of two un-named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm,0.0,26.0
incidents like this happen said mr thiemann because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers,1.0,31.0
this often means that all the cash machines and computers in bank share the same data network,1.0,17.0
this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have common transmission system he said,1.0,24.0
banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network mr thiemann told bbc news online,0.0,23.0
but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year,1.0,25.0
currently he said cash machine has lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10 of all atms get swapped for newer model every year,1.0,28.0
windows cash machines have been around for several years he said,1.0,11.0
most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle,0.0,11.0
in theory there is bigger threat with windows than os he said but do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment,0.0,25.0
it pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms he said,0.0,12.0
the many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously he said,1.0,27.0
banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all he added,0.0,29.0
spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services apacs which represents the uk payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal,0.0,23.0
there no concern that there going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks he said,0.0,18.0
risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the us where viruses have struck,0.0,36.0
the official re-election site of president george bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons,1.0,17.0
the blocking began early on monday so those outside the us and trying to view the site got message saying they are not authorised to view it,1.0,27.0
but keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective,0.0,14.0
many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses,1.0,18.0
the policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.com website,1.0,26.0
scott stanzel spokesman for the bush-cheney campaign said the measure was taken for security reasons,0.0,15.0
he declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy,0.0,10.0
the barring of non-us visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make statement about why the blocking was taking place,0.0,27.0
in early october so-called denial of service attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of pcs,1.0,22.0
the attack made the site unusable for about five hours,0.0,10.0
about the same time the web team of the bush-cheney campaign started using the services of company called akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic,0.0,31.0
akamai uses web-based tool called edgescape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based,0.0,16.0
typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic,0.0,23.0
geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on regional basis,0.0,20.0
readers of the boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the george bush domain name,0.0,25.0
ironically one of the working alternatives is for supposedly more secure version of the site,0.0,15.0
there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bush-cheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site,1.0,23.0
the site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us,1.0,16.0
some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site,1.0,13.0
the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites,0.0,24.0
netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney have failed,0.0,26.0
by contrast netcraft four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems,1.0,17.0
data gathered by netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack,1.0,26.0
mike prettejohn netcraft president speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run-up to the election on november,0.0,26.0
he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week,0.0,20.0
managing traffic could also be good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign,1.0,22.0
however simply blocking non-us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too,0.0,13.0
most american soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the us military own portion of the net,1.0,23.0
akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites,0.0,12.0

the idea of an intelligent card in boxes offers lot of possibilities,0.0,12.0
it will be down to the ingenuity of the content players said mr whalley,0.0,14.0
for the bbc revenue-generating activity will be of little interest but the new development may prompt changes to freeview set-top boxes said mr whalley,0.0,24.0
currently most freeview boxes do not have slot which would allow viewers to use smartcard,0.0,15.0
some 7.4 million households have sky boxes and sky is hoping to increase this to 10 million by 2010,0.0,19.0

the force is strong in battlefront,0.0,6.0
the warm reception that has greeted star wars battlefront is reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient,1.0,28.0
geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than series of all-out gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies,0.0,33.0
previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters,0.0,40.0

it is worth noting though that on the playstation the game graphics are curiously long way behind those of the xbox version,0.0,22.0
the pivotal element behind battlefront success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large-scale war,0.0,25.0
the number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over,1.0,21.0
speaking of noise battlefront is real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxy audio motifs,1.0,17.0
the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up,1.0,22.0
there is also particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section,0.0,15.0
it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars it would not stand up for long,1.0,24.0
the gameplay is reliable bog-standard stuff short on originality,0.0,9.0
there are also odd annoyances like the game insistence on re-spawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear,0.0,31.0
and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be,0.0,19.0
that said it is still great fun to pilot scout walker or speeder bike however non user-friendly they prove,0.0,19.0
whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game,1.0,20.0
the above-average ai of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated,0.0,28.0

asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds,0.0,14.0
the standard speed is 512kbps though faster connections are available,0.0,10.0

microsoft xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales,1.0,13.0

the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to sailor wellbeing and therefore it says to safer shipping and cleaner oceans,0.0,29.0

we predicted at the beginning of the decade that the digital approach would be taken for granted but there was lot of work to do,0.0,25.0
what is fun is to come to the show and see what has been done,0.0,15.0
it is going even faster than we expected and we are excited about it,0.0,14.0
he highlighted technology trends over the last year that had driven the need to make technology and transferring content across difference devices seamless,1.0,23.0
gaming is becoming more of social thing and all of the social genres will use this rich communications,0.0,18.0
and if we look at what has been going on with e-mail instant messaging blogging entertainment if we can make this seamless we can create something quite phenomenal,0.0,28.0
mr gates said the pc like microsoft media centre had central role to play in how people would be making the most out of audio video and images but it would not be the only device,1.0,36.0
it is the way all these devices work together which will make the difference he said,1.0,16.0

although most of these affected largely us consumers the technologies highlighted the kind of trends to come,0.0,17.0
these included what mr gates called an ecosystem of technologies like sbc iptv high-definition tv and digital video recorder that worked via broadband to give high-quality and fast tv,0.0,29.0

the grand theft auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition,0.0,34.0
the 18 certificate gta san andreas for the playstation could have got away with merely revisiting best-selling formula with more-of-the-same approach,1.0,21.0
instead it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps carefree over all the driv3r and true crime-shaped opposition,1.0,23.0
even in the year that will see sequels to halo and half-life it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic,0.0,23.0
you control character on this occasion youth named cj who sets out on series of self-contained missions within massive 3d environment,1.0,21.0
cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from push-bike to city bus to plane,1.0,15.0
all come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family,0.0,24.0
to make things worse he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel jackson and chris penn,0.0,27.0
the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas comprising three major cities los santos which is thinly-disguised los angeles san fierro aka san francisco and las venturas carbon copy of las vegas,1.0,39.0
san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing,1.0,16.0
its ability to capture the ambience of the real-world versions of these cities is something to behold assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city,1.0,28.0
the streets and vast swathes of countryside are by turns gloriously menacing grungy and preppy,0.0,15.0
flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail the game overall look particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets is stupendous,0.0,22.0
the outstanding bread-and-butter gameplay mechanics provide solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on,0.0,15.0
cars handle more convincingly than ever superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds and there more traffic to navigate than before,0.0,24.0
park your vehicle across the lanes of freeway and within seconds there will be huge pile-up,0.0,16.0
pedestrians are also out in force and are loquacious bunch,0.0,10.0

they will pass comments on his appearance and credibility aspects that the player now has control over,0.0,17.0

he will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up but will swell up as result of over-eating,0.0,21.0
and at last this is gta hero who can swim,0.0,10.0
at time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young san andreas violence or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence are sure to inflame the pro-censorship brigade,1.0,38.0
developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality and in some respects ramp it up from past outings,1.0,18.0
when hijacking car for example cj will gratuitously shove the driver head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle,0.0,23.0
indeed the tone is darker than the jokey vice city,0.0,10.0
the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game,1.0,24.0
this title incidentally is set in 1992 but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists,0.0,25.0
the wit is still present just more restrained than in previous outings,0.0,12.0
further reason for this is that the incredible range of in-vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options where gta games trademark humour is anchored,1.0,34.0
the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off-the-chart,1.0,11.0
the game rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in way that rings very true indeed,0.0,17.0
it is testament to san andreas magnificence that it has number of prominent flaws but plus-points are so numerous that the niggles don detract,1.0,24.0
the on-screen map for instance is needlessly fiddly an unwelcome change from past editions,0.0,14.0
there is also very jarring slowdown at action-packed moments,0.0,9.0
and the game suffers from the age-old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre setting you back vast distance when you fail right at the very end of long mission,1.0,36.0
but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive,1.0,10.0
you simply will not be bothered by these minor failings,0.0,10.0
san andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004,1.0,10.0
bt offers free net phone calls,0.0,6.0
bt is offering customers free internet telephone calls if they sign up to broadband in december,1.0,16.0
the christmas give-away entitles customers to free telephone calls anywhere in the uk via the internet,0.0,16.0
users will need to use bt internet telephony software known as bt communicator and have microphone and speakers or headset on their pc,0.0,23.0
bt has launched the promotion to show off the potential of broadband connection to customers,1.0,15.0
people wanting to take advantage of the offer will need to be bt together fixed-line customer and will have to sign up to broadband online,1.0,25.0
"the offer will be limited to the first 50,000 people who sign up and there are limitations the free calls do not include calls to mobiles non-geographical numbers such as 0870 premium numbers or international numbers",0.0,36.0
bt is keen to provide extra services to its broadband customers,1.0,11.0
people already using bt communicator have found it by far the most convenient way of making call if they are at their pc said andrew burke director of value-added services at bt retail,0.0,33.0
as more homes get high-speed access providers are increasingly offering add-ons such as cheap net calls,0.0,16.0
broadband and telephony are attractive to customers and bt wants to make sure it is in the first wave of services said ian fogg an analyst with jupiter research,0.0,29.0
bt communicator had quiet launch in the summer and now bt is waving the flag bit more for it he added,0.0,21.0
bt has struggled to maintain its market share of broadband subscribers as more competitors enter the market,1.0,17.0
reports say that bt has lost around 10 of market share over the last year down from half of broadband users to less than 40,0.0,25.0
bt is hoping its latest offer can persuade more people to jump on the broadband bandwagon,1.0,16.0
it currently has 1.3 million broadband subscribers,0.0,7.0
it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past,0.0,23.0
when history takes look back at great inventions like the car and transistor they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people lives substantially,1.0,23.0
but says nick donofrio senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at ibm it was not the thing itself that actually improved people lives,1.0,23.0
it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it,0.0,16.0
the car brought about crucial change to how people lived in cities giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs whilst having mobility and access,0.0,27.0
when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century we have to think more like this but faster mr donofrio told the bbc news website after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture,1.0,39.0
the invention discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had,0.0,19.0
the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered but by themselves they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did,0.0,31.0
these are not altogether new ideas and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years,0.0,18.0
but what it means for technology companies is that new idea method or device will have to have different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them,1.0,35.0
we are in different phase now when it comes to technology argues mr donofrio industry week 2003 technology leader of the year,1.0,22.0
the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work make sense make difference and life gets better as result,1.0,26.0
in the dotcom era there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes,0.0,17.0
somebody had new thing that would awe you,0.0,8.0
you weren quite sure that it did anything you weren quite sure if you needed it you weren quite sure if it had value for it but it was cool,0.0,30.0
but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives he says will come about slowly subtlety and in ways that will no longer be in your face,1.0,32.0
nanotechnologies will play key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways through new superconducting materials to coatings power and memory storage,0.0,26.0
am very big believer in the evolution of this industry into pervasive environment in an incredible network infrastructure says mr donofrio,1.0,21.0
pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules and where jewellery clothes and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires screens and keyboards,0.0,24.0
the net becomes true network that is taken for granted and just there like air,0.0,15.0
people will not have to do anything to stay connected,0.0,10.0
people will know their lives are just better says mr donofrio,1.0,11.0
trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know,1.0,15.0
natural interfaces will develop devices will shape your persona and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances,0.0,24.0
ultimately there will be says mr donofrio no value in being computer illiterate,1.0,13.0
to some it sounds like technological world gone mad,0.0,9.0
to mr donofrio it is vision innovation that will happen,1.0,10.0
behind this vision should be rich robust network capability and deep computing says mr donofrio,1.0,15.0
deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data and integral to this concept is supercomputing,0.0,23.0
it has value according to ibm because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions like how to refine millions of net search results finding cures for diseases or understanding of exactly how gene or protein operates,0.0,43.0

microsoft internet explorer has serious rival in the long-awaited firefox 1.0 web browser which has just been released,1.0,18.0
few people get excited when some new software is released especially when the program is not game or music or movie player,0.0,22.0
but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up respectable amount of pre-launch fervour,1.0,20.0
fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available,0.0,29.0
the release of firefox 1.0 on november might even cause few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant internet explorer browser,1.0,31.0
firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998,1.0,19.0
much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february,1.0,22.0
earlier incarnations but which had the same core technology were called phoenix and firebird,0.0,14.0
since then the software has been gaining praise and converts not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft internet explorer,1.0,29.0
rivals to ie got boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to serious vulnerability,0.0,28.0
internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie,1.0,27.0
before july this year according to websidestory internet explorer was used by about 95 of web surfers,0.0,17.0
that figure had remained static for years,0.0,7.0
in july the ie using population dropped to 94.7 and by the end of october stood at 92.9,0.0,18.0
the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10 of the windows- using net-browsing population,1.0,30.0
firefox is proving popular because at the moment it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft program,1.0,25.0
for instance firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them,0.0,21.0
it blocks pop-ups has neat way of finding text on page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed,0.0,21.0
one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras or extensions produced for it,0.0,19.0
the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program,0.0,30.0
this has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from version of the familiar google toolbar to homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels,0.0,35.0
firefox which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix also has growing number of vocal net-based fans,1.0,19.0

they were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to,0.0,15.0
nothing distracts you when you were playing,0.0,7.0
there was nothing in halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be,1.0,22.0
he added graphically it was superior to everything else out there,0.0,11.0
it also had depth to it that made it stand out,0.0,11.0
halo was unusually immersive sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller,1.0,18.0

when the xbox launched on november 15 2001 in the us halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers,1.0,27.0
halo is the most important launch game for any console ever wrote the influential edge magazine in its review giving it rare 10 out of 10 mark,1.0,27.0
the game had its critics and while it is not one-off original as game it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since,0.0,33.0
the first time played it just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun said errera remarking on the level of detail in the game,1.0,28.0
the game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game,1.0,35.0
it blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of halo said errera referring to fan who had created video of master chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world,1.0,35.0
video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained cult following,0.0,26.0

errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high,0.0,11.0
it does not feel like game release any more,0.0,9.0
somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in microsoft history,0.0,15.0
we re all just hoping that bungie has got it right again,0.0,12.0

uk gamers have until 12 november to register their interest in taking part and can sign up via the four-kings jolt.co.uk and painkiller tournament websites,1.0,25.0
philip wride who co-manages the four-kings team said online qualifiers will be held from 16-28 november to find the best eight players of the painkiller game,1.0,26.0
he said the clan was running the contest because four-kings does not currently have any players that excel at painkiller,1.0,20.0
these eight players will be brought together in london on 3-5 december for the bloodline tournament that will find the best two players,0.0,23.0
the event will be filmed and the final cut made available online for others to watch,0.0,16.0
the movie is being put together by simon bysshe who has shot many other films about pro-gaming that have been widely shared online,0.0,23.0
said mr bysshe painkiller is new game and the opportunity is there for new player to step up,1.0,18.0
painkiller has been described as game that adds few modern touches such as improved graphics to the old-fashioned first-person shooter,0.0,20.0
these two players will be put forward as the uk entrants to the cyberathlete professional league 1m painkiller contest that will take place throughout 2005,0.0,25.0

the first stop on the world tour will be istanbul turkey from 10-13 february,0.0,14.0
"total of 50,000 in cash prizes is on offer",0.0,9.0
the cpl has said that it picked one-on-one game such as painkiller to make it easier for spectators to follow the action,1.0,22.0
counter-strike by far the most popular online game pits teams against each other and can be confusing to follow if those watching are not familiar with the layout of the maps on which it is played,0.0,36.0
the decision to pick painkiller was greeted with surprise by many gamers as it was widely expected that doom would be chosen as the one-one-one title,0.0,26.0

sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call he says,1.0,21.0

mr rampersad who used to work in the military knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster,1.0,22.0
he wondered if there might be way to automatically centralise text messages and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help,1.0,26.0
mr rampersad said imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted need for water purification tablets and had central place to send text message to that effect,1.0,28.0
he can message the server so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field,1.0,30.0
he added or send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region and they might have an excess of it and be able to shift supplies to the right places,0.0,37.0
mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september,0.0,24.0

it is still very early days for the project though,0.0,10.0
in an e-mail dan lane calls it an early proof of concept,0.0,12.0
right now the alert retrieval cache can only take text message and automatically upload it to web-page or distribute it to an e-mail list,1.0,24.0
in the near future the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages,1.0,32.0
you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use,1.0,16.0
it amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to and say look this is what we re trying to do and everything like that says mr rampersad,0.0,32.0

basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist,0.0,8.0
together with speech and voice recognition systems they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future,0.0,18.0

he is very childlike he likes visual stimulus he told the bbc news website,0.0,14.0

if you ignore him he gets angry,0.0,7.0
if you leave he gets sad,0.0,6.0
and you can also even surprise him,0.0,7.0
it works on vision reacting in preset way to the information provided by surveillance tracker system,0.0,16.0
it is not able to talk or to hear you at least not yet,0.0,14.0
the surrey team is already working on jeremiah next version that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature finn the fish,0.0,26.0
am interested in the interaction providing the ability of system to watch what going on and make decisions based on that explained dr bowden,1.0,24.0
the research comes at time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets,0.0,18.0
experts say much more natural way to interact with these devices such as virtual human could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos,1.0,29.0
if you get up at three clock in the morning and you go downstairs there are probably two things you are going to do either going to the bathroom or maybe you are going to make cup of tea said dr bowden,1.0,42.0
now if the system can watch your behaviour over time it can learn this so it would predict what you are going to do turn on the lights for you or before you even get to the kettle it could have switched it on,1.0,44.0
you might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left,1.0,35.0
this might sound like scary vision of an orwellian future,0.0,10.0
but it might all depend on the face that is watching you,1.0,12.0
when we put the surveillance cameras in our centre lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was system watching them said dr bowden,1.0,27.0

for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager cm,1.0,24.0
indeed it seems like there has been cm game for as many years as there have been pcs,1.0,18.0
however last year was the final time that developers sports interactive si and publishers eidos would work together,1.0,18.0
they decided to go their separate ways and each kept piece of the franchise,0.0,14.0
si kept the game code and database and eidos retained rights to the cm brand and the look and feel of the game,1.0,23.0
so at the beginning of this year fans faced new situation,0.0,11.0
eidos announced the next cm game with new team to develop it from scratch whilst si developed the existing code further to be released with new publishers sega under the name football manager,1.0,33.0
well football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series and it has been released earlier than expected,1.0,19.0
at this point cm5 looks like it will ship early next year,1.0,12.0
but given that football manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves how does this new version shape up,1.0,24.0
game like fm2005 could blind you with statistics,1.0,8.0
it has an obscene number of playable leagues an obscene number of manageable teams and really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database with stats faithfully researched and compiled by loyal army of fans,0.0,40.0
but that does not do justice to the game really,1.0,10.0
what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth,1.0,19.0
you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from for instance england and scotland,0.0,19.0
that will give you choice not just of the four main scottish leagues but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south,0.0,27.0
of course you might be looking for european glory or to get hold of abramovich millions in which case you can take control at chelsea or even barcelona real madrid ac milan the list goes on very long way,0.0,39.0
once in team you will be told by the board what they expect of you,0.0,15.0
sometimes it is promotion or place in europe sometimes it is consolidation or brave relegation battle,0.0,16.0
it might even be case of champions or else,0.0,9.0
obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose so choose wisely,0.0,13.0
then it is time to look at your squad work out your tactics seeing how much cash if any you have got to splash having look at the transfer market sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it,0.0,45.0
then bring on the matches which are once more available in the ever-improving top down 2d view,0.0,17.0
with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface not much else seems to have changed,0.0,18.0
however there have been lot of changes under the bonnet as well things like the manager mind-games which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses,0.0,28.0
the match engine is also much improved and it is more of joy than ever to watch,0.0,17.0
in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked and it leads to an ever more immersive experience,1.0,21.0
with game that is so complex and so open-ended there are of course few glitches but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases,0.0,27.0
with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches though there have been improvements in this area,1.0,25.0
and sport like football which is so high profile and unpredictable itself can never be modelled quite to everybody satisfaction,0.0,20.0
but this time around great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay,0.0,30.0
and if there are problems further down the line sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible,0.0,26.0
in all there are many more tweaks and improvements,0.0,9.0
if you were fan of the previous cm games then fm2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it,1.0,21.0
if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership spurs into europe or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree fm2005 could be the best purchase you ever made,1.0,42.0
just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas,0.0,13.0
football manager 2005 out now for the pc and the mac,1.0,11.0
musicians are embracing the internet as way of reaching new fans and selling more music survey has found,1.0,18.0
the study by us researchers pew internet suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing,1.0,22.0
while most considered file-sharing as illegal many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders,0.0,14.0
even successful artists don think the lawsuits will benefit musicians said report author mary madden,1.0,15.0
"for part of the study pew internet conducted an online survey of 2,755 musicians songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april 2004",1.0,27.0
they ranged from full-time successful musicians to artists struggling to make living from their music,1.0,15.0
we looked at more of the independent musicians rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry ms madden told the bbc news website,1.0,33.0
we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented,0.0,22.0
the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet rather than seeing it as just threat to their livelihood,1.0,21.0
almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration with nine out of 10 going online to promote advertise and post their music on the web,0.0,28.0
more than 80 offered free samples online while two-thirds sold their music via the net,0.0,15.0
independent musicians in particular saw the internet as way to get around the need to land record contract and reach fans directly,0.0,22.0
musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically said ms madden,1.0,9.0
they are using the internet to gain inspiration sell it online tracking royalties learning about copyright,0.0,16.0
perhaps surprisingly opinions about online file-sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry,0.0,19.0
through the recording industry association of america riaa it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music,0.0,25.0
but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us,0.0,17.0
it found that most artists saw file-sharing as both good and bad though most agreed that it should be illegal,0.0,20.0
free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing said one musician quoted by the report,0.0,22.0
it hard to keep making records if they don pay for themselves through sales,0.0,14.0
however 60 said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters,0.0,17.0

games win for blu-ray dvd format,0.0,6.0
the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival according to its backers,0.0,16.0
blu-ray backed by 100 firms including sony is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games,1.0,25.0
the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format,1.0,19.0
the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound,1.0,11.0
this offers incredible 3d-like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year,0.0,23.0
in separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005,1.0,30.0
as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images we have much greater need for storage richard doherty from panasonic hollywood laboratories one of the pioneers of blu-ray told the bbc news website,0.0,35.0
so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today dvd,1.0,23.0
blu-ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high-quality data while toshiba hd-dvd will hold 30gb,1.0,17.0
mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders,1.0,30.0
both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out,1.0,37.0
when players do come out they will be able to play standard dvds too which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds,0.0,27.0
but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy,0.0,18.0
gaming is 20 billion industry worldwide so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made,0.0,21.0
the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies said michael heilmann chief technology officer for vivendi universal,0.0,21.0
blu-ray offers the capacity performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming,0.0,17.0
ea leading games developer and publisher added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning,1.0,35.0
sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations,1.0,15.0
mr doherty said gamers were ravenous for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles,1.0,17.0
gamers especially those working on pcs are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures deeper levels for delivering higher-resolution playback,0.0,21.0
he added the focus for games moving forward on increased immersion,0.0,11.0
gaming companies really like to focus on creating world which involves creating complicated 3d models and textures and increasing the resolution increasing the frame rate all of these are part of getting more immersive experience,0.0,35.0
fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost,1.0,20.0
as games move to more photo-real capability the current technology is limiting,1.0,12.0
they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments said mr doherty,0.0,17.0
currently graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation,0.0,10.0
high-definition dvds will cut down on that need,0.0,8.0
likewise consoles rely on single discs so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better high-resolution games,0.0,20.0
blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios such as mgm studios disney and buena vista as well as top technology firms like dell lg samsung and phillips amongst others,0.0,31.0
while toshiba hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount universal and warner bros. the real world benefits of hd-dvd are apparent and obvious said jim cardwell president of warner home video,0.0,31.0
mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd,0.0,19.0
both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox but discussions are still on-going,0.0,21.0

legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of system that could be harder to shut down,0.0,23.0
one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program,1.0,23.0
test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january,0.0,13.0
but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies,0.0,16.0
in late december movie studios launched legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network,0.0,20.0
the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised,0.0,12.0
that file-sharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for,0.0,22.0
shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network,0.0,10.0
one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to,1.0,35.0
now the man behind suprnova.org who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for new file-swapping network dubbed exeem,0.0,22.0
in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems,1.0,20.0
like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want,1.0,15.0
like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone,0.0,9.0
there will be no centrally maintained list,0.0,7.0
this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music,1.0,21.0
the exeem software has been under development for few months and is currently being tested by closed group of users,0.0,20.0
an early public version of the software should be available before february,0.0,12.0
sloncek said that currently only windows version of the software was in development,1.0,13.0
there were no plans for linux or mac version,0.0,9.0
he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program,1.0,22.0
despite suprnova administrator sloncek involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis,0.0,30.0
users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream,1.0,24.0
dr johan pouwelse researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems,0.0,23.0
but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared,1.0,32.0
exeem can not prevent pollution he said,1.0,7.0
the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said,1.0,21.0
studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes,0.0,21.0
by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality,0.0,13.0
the moderators are the difference between having system that works and one that full of crap like kazaa he said,1.0,20.0
there is fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said,0.0,10.0
mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading,1.0,36.0
when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse,1.0,13.0
he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic,0.0,37.0
it hard to compete with free he said,0.0,8.0

the us presidential election provided showcase for many aimed at talking directly to generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads,0.0,22.0
experts say this reflects how video games are becoming mainstream part of culture and society,0.0,15.0
the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003 the iowa game commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean,1.0,25.0

others helped raise the stakes during the bush kerry contest by highlighting candidate virtues or his vices,0.0,17.0
the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers,1.0,18.0
when started researching political games at the university about five years ago thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen said gonzalo frasca computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen,1.0,38.0
must admit that was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved added the uruguayan-born researcher who has so far created games for two political campaigns,1.0,31.0
many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com,0.0,19.0
the aim is to comment on international news events via games,0.0,11.0
the ability of games to simulate reality makes them powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way,0.0,21.0
video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation mr frasca told the bbc news website,1.0,30.0
this was the case with the one he created for political party in uruguay cambiemos an online puzzle game that offered view on how the country problems could be solved by working together,0.0,33.0
it up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games,1.0,17.0
ultimately dr frasca sees games as small laboratory where we can play with our hopes fears and beliefs,0.0,18.0
children learn lot about the world through play,0.0,8.0
there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up,0.0,15.0
but experts estimate it will still take at least about decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become common tool for political campaigns,1.0,25.0
this is hardly surprising compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web,0.0,15.0
only few years ago most politicians did not have webpage while now it is almost must-have,0.0,16.0
dr frasca said political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games,1.0,12.0
they represent new tool of communication that can reach younger audience in language that can clearly speak to them,0.0,19.0
it will not replace other forms of political propaganda but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns,1.0,22.0
the number of europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months with the web eating into tv viewing habits research suggests,1.0,23.0
just over 54 million people are hooked up to the net via broadband up from 34 million year ago according to market analysts nielsen netratings,1.0,25.0
the total number of people online in europe has broken the 100 million mark,0.0,14.0
the popularity of the net has meant that many are turning away from tv say analysts jupiter research,0.0,18.0

the biggest jump was in italy where it rose by 120,0.0,11.0
britain was close behind with broadband users almost doubling in year,0.0,11.0
the growth has been fuelled by lower prices and wider choice of always-on fast-net subscription plans,0.0,16.0

no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign,0.0,16.0
lycos europe make love not spam campaign was intended as way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes,0.0,24.0
people were encouraged to download the screensaver which when their pc was idle would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages,1.0,31.0
lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95 capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites,1.0,25.0
but the plan has proved controversial,0.0,6.0
monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that number were completely knocked offline,0.0,23.0
the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to distributed denial of service attack,1.0,23.0
in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them,1.0,16.0
laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences,0.0,23.0
lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold,0.0,11.0
the site hosting the screensaver currently shows holding page with the words stay tuned,1.0,14.0
the numerical internet address of the site has also changed,0.0,10.0
this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site,1.0,23.0
the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web,0.0,12.0
many discussion groups have said that it set dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism,0.0,14.0
attacking spammer website is like poking grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with pointy stick said graham cluley senior technology consultant for sophos,0.0,24.0

it all part of what known as pervasive ambient world where chips are everywhere,0.0,14.0
mr pearson does not have crystal ball,0.0,7.0
his job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now to guide industries into the future,1.0,21.0
inanimate objects will start to interact with us we will be surrounded on streets in homes in appliances on our bodies and possibly in our heads by things that think,0.0,30.0
forget local area networks these will be body area networks,0.0,10.0
ideas about just how smart small or even invisible technology will get are always floating around,1.0,16.0
images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology,1.0,16.0
but now new vision is surfacing where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality form or aesthetics,0.0,20.0
such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed,1.0,15.0
so mp3 players the mass gadget of the moment will disappear and instead become integrated into one clothing says mr pearson,1.0,21.0
so the gadgets that fill up your handbag when we integrate those into fabric we can actually get rid of all that stuff,0.0,23.0
you won necessarily see the electronics,0.0,6.0
wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up while video tattoos or intelligent electronic contact lenses might function as tv screens for those on the move,1.0,28.0
however this future of highly personal devices where technology is worn or even fuses with the body itself raises ethical questions,1.0,21.0
if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing jewellery and skin there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans says baroness susan greenfield,1.0,32.0
at recent conference for technology engineering academic and fashion industry experts at the royal society in london neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we can just sleepwalk into the future,1.0,28.0
yet this technology is already upon us,1.0,7.0
researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing,0.0,9.0
mp3 jackets based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves have already appeared in shops,1.0,22.0
these smart fabrics have come about through advances in nano- and micro-engineering the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale,0.0,24.0
at the nanoscale materials can be tuned to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster lighter stronger and more efficient devices and systems,0.0,26.0
the textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways,0.0,18.0
many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine defence healthcare sports and communications,0.0,17.0
professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin,0.0,13.0
nanoscale titanium dioxide tio2 coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti-odour properties,0.0,11.0

such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance to turn airline seats into super stain-resistant surfaces and applied to windows so they clean themselves,0.0,28.0
dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin,0.0,22.0
but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being,1.0,19.0
if our clothing skin and personal body networks do the talking and the monitoring everywhere we go we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy,1.0,30.0
mr pearson picks up the theme pointing out there are lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become cyborgian,0.0,22.0
we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and lot of that information you really don want every passer-by to know,1.0,27.0
so we have to make sure we build security in this,0.0,11.0
if you are wearing smart make-up where electronics are controlling the appearance you don want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead,0.0,24.0
as technology infiltrates our biology how will our brains function differently,1.0,11.0
we can not arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this warns baroness greenfield,1.0,17.0

there will also be more focus on the design of technologies following the lead that apple ipod made with ease of use and good looks which appeal to wider range of people key concern,0.0,34.0
the cea predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year,1.0,17.0
gaming would continue to thrive especially on mobile devices and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women,0.0,20.0
games consoles sales have been declining but the launch of next generation consoles such as microsoft xbox and playstation could buoy up sales,0.0,23.0
although it has been widely predicted that mr gates would be showcasing the new xbox some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote,1.0,31.0

the real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net argues analyst bill thompson,1.0,19.0
it is what happens when it arrives at the other end,0.0,11.0
the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data,1.0,29.0
the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society our identities,1.0,29.0
armed with the personal details that bank holds plus fake letter or two it is apparently easy to get loan open bank account with an overdraft or get credit card in someone else name,1.0,34.0
and it is then simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving,0.0,31.0
identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish,0.0,29.0
but however careful you may be if the organisations you trust with your personal data bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble,1.0,34.0
it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that well-placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of computer system,0.0,29.0
in fact suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather long time,0.0,28.0
has anyone checked bob cratchit family links to the criminal underworld wonder,0.0,12.0
and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted,0.0,13.0
health authorities government agencies and of course the big e-commerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters,0.0,21.0
the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to,0.0,23.0
and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details,1.0,41.0
fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office plugging it into usb slot and sucking down customer files,1.0,40.0
companies like securewave for example can restrict the use of usb ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual personal memory card,0.0,24.0
these solutions are not perfect but it does not feel like wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system,0.0,23.0
however the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e-commerce and online trading the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the back office,0.0,31.0
it has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked,0.0,39.0
in fact do not know of single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud,1.0,19.0
there are simply too many e-mails passing over the net for interception to be sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud,0.0,22.0
cd universe powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences,0.0,16.0
and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess login name,1.0,24.0
whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job the issue is the same how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused,1.0,42.0
any organisation that processes personal data is of course bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it,1.0,22.0
unauthorised disclosure is not allowed but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice,0.0,26.0
this is not something we can just leave it to the market,0.0,12.0
the consequences of having one identity stolen are too serious and markets respond too slowly,0.0,15.0
after all bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that did not even consider it when heard about their security problems,1.0,28.0
doubt many others have closed their accounts especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future,1.0,28.0
the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes or wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft,1.0,41.0
have never felt comfortable with the us practice of suing everything that moves partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients so know which prefer,0.0,28.0

how people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change following the launch of an ambitious european project,1.0,19.0
in nice last week the european commission announced its networked electronic media nem initiative,0.0,14.0
its broad scope stretches from the way media is created through each of the stages of its distribution to its playback,0.0,21.0
the commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly when on the move at home or at work no matter who supplies the devices network content or content protection scheme,1.0,39.0
more than 120 experts were in nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as nokia intel philips alcatel france telecom thomson and telefonica,0.0,32.0
it might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together,0.0,17.0
but again and again speakers stated they could not see incompatible stand-alone solutions working,0.0,14.0
long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required,0.0,14.0
the european commission is being pragmatic in its approach,1.0,9.0
they have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that nem encompasses,1.0,19.0
the nem approach is to take serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline pick out the best bring them together and identify where the gaps are,0.0,31.0
where it finds holes it will develop standards to fill them,0.0,11.0
what is significant is that such large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget,1.0,27.0
this is bound to please if not surprise many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer,0.0,35.0
many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the commission will be to identify solution for different digital rights management drm schemes,1.0,24.0
currently drm solutions are incompatible locking certain types of purchased content making them unplayable on all platforms,0.0,17.0
with the potential of having percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally the prize for being the supplier of the world dominant drm scheme is huge,0.0,28.0

simon perry is the editor of the digital lifestyles website which covers the impact of technology on media,1.0,18.0
the web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago,0.0,12.0
back in 1994 yahoo had only just launched most websites were text-based and amazon google and ebay had yet to appear,0.0,21.0
but says usability guru dr jakob nielsen some things have stayed constant in that decade namely the principles of what makes site easy to use,1.0,25.0
dr nielsen has looked back at decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today,1.0,29.0
roughly 80 of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today he said,1.0,17.0
some have gone away because users have changed and 10 have changed because technology has changed,0.0,16.0
some design crimes such as splash screens that get between user and the site they are trying to visit and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared said dr nielsen,1.0,32.0
but there great stability on usability concerns he told the bbc news website,0.0,13.0
dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability centring around ease of use and clear thinking about site total design were as important as ever,1.0,25.0
it necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such he said,0.0,17.0
they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would,0.0,17.0
lot of people thought that design and usability was only temporary problem because broadband was taking off he said,1.0,19.0
but there are very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband,0.0,17.0
dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google amazon ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important,1.0,25.0
those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful said dr nielsen adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net,1.0,23.0
all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet he said,1.0,20.0
they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user,0.0,11.0
none of them have fancy or glamorous look he added declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied,0.0,22.0
in the future dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online,0.0,28.0
they are becoming like the operating system to the internet he said,0.0,12.0
but he said the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better,0.0,19.0
currently he said search sites did not do very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries,0.0,22.0
often people had to look at website just to judge whether it was useful or not,1.0,16.0
tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results,0.0,21.0
research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines,1.0,17.0
the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that on average they use 2.2 terms,0.0,20.0
in 1994 only 1.3 words were used,0.0,7.0
think it amazing that we have seen doubling in 10-year period of those search terms said dr nielsen,1.0,18.0

simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2d side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter,1.0,22.0
it is also the toughest game you are likely to play as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on,0.0,22.0
players must battle soldiers snowmen zombies giant crabs and aliens not to mention the huge screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels,0.0,24.0
the shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius,0.0,10.0
fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers instead to the vast array of vehicles on offer in game stuffed with bizarre hardware,1.0,24.0

games aimed at casual players are set to be even bigger in 2005 according to industry experts,0.0,17.0
easy-to-play titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year,0.0,27.0
the trend shows that gaming is not just about big-hitting games console titles which appeal more to hardcore gamers said panel of experts,1.0,23.0
they were speaking before the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas which showcases the latest trends in gadgets and technologies for 2005,0.0,23.0
the panel also insisted that casual gamers were not just women common misconception which pervades current thinking about gamer demographics,0.0,20.0
casual games like poker pool bridge bingo and puzzle-based titles which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices were gender neutral and different genres attracted different players,1.0,29.0
greg mills program director at aol said its figures suggested that sports-based games attracted 90 of 18 to 24-year-old males while puzzle games were played by 80 of females,0.0,29.0
games like bridge tended to attract the over-50 demographic of gamers,0.0,11.0
but hardcore gamers who are more attracted to blockbuster gamers which usually require hi-spec pcs like half-life or halo on xbox also liked to have different type of gaming experience,1.0,30.0
when hardcore gamers are not playing halo they are playing poker and pool based on our research said geoff graber director of yahoo games which attracts about 12 million gamers month,1.0,31.0
with the growth of powerful pc technology and ownership broadband take-up portable players and mobile devices as well as interactive tv casual gaming is shaping up to be big business in 2005 according to the panel,0.0,36.0
the focus for the coming year should be about attracting third-party developers into the field to offer more innovative and multiplayer titles they agreed,0.0,24.0
we are at time where we are on the verge of something much bigger said mr graber,0.0,17.0
casual games will get into their stride in 2005 will be really big in 2006 and will be about community,0.0,20.0
with more people finding more to do with their gadgets and high-speed connections casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as form of mass-market entertainment to more people,1.0,32.0
key to these types of titles is the chance they give people who may not see themselves as gamers to dip in and out of games when they liked,1.0,29.0
portal sites which offer casual games like aol yahoo and realarcade as well as other games-on-demand services allow people to build up buddy lists so they can return and play against the same people,1.0,34.0
this aspect of community is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in 30 to 40 console or pc titles said the panel,1.0,38.0

only wanted player that could handle games and video,0.0,9.0
dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in europe today despite their high prices said ian fogg jupiter analyst,1.0,22.0
mr fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating dual-purpose device,0.0,33.0
europeans care most about music playback he said,0.0,8.0

we are reaching the point where broadband is central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst bill thompson,1.0,22.0
one of the nice things about being writer is that rarely have to go to an office to work,0.0,19.0
can sit in caf 233 or library with or without wi-fi connection and research and write articles,0.0,17.0
if am passing through kings cross station on my way to meeting then can log on from the platform,0.0,19.0
and can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne children writer at her house in cambridge sharing her wireless network,0.0,21.0
but just over week ago arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection,1.0,17.0
we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again,0.0,41.0
she called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with new cable modem,0.0,24.0
this did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday,0.0,19.0
with no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial-up connection on her daughter laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting slower and flakier net connection,1.0,45.0
as result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial-up,0.0,25.0
she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively,0.0,24.0
but the impact spread into her personal life too,0.0,9.0
she did not take her children to the cinema during half-term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas,0.0,25.0
she planned trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website,0.0,26.0
and she did not know where to go fossil-hunting on the trip because she could not type fossils norfolk into google,1.0,21.0
of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found book on fossils,0.0,28.0
but she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things,1.0,46.0
she may be unusual but do not think anne is alone,0.0,11.0
according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april 2004 and numbers are climbing fast,1.0,21.0
there will certainly be five million by the end of the year,0.0,12.0
dial-up users are switching to broadband,1.0,6.0
my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start,1.0,19.0
more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they can not get online for any reason,1.0,39.0
it is part of the process of adaptation and it is vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere,1.0,23.0
people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do,1.0,24.0
they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity,1.0,27.0
of course broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world,1.0,16.0
in south korea japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with,0.0,31.0
but speed is only small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even uk speeds are sufficient,1.0,50.0
it may not be the brave new world of streaming full-screen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now,0.0,22.0
and it is certainly better than slow access or no access,0.0,11.0

both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive,1.0,15.0

nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since,1.0,15.0
but its lead can no longer be taken for granted,0.0,10.0
sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while start-up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices,0.0,24.0

it went on sale in the us in mid-november priced 150 and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures,0.0,22.0
japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device,0.0,17.0
with more than two million pre-orders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot,1.0,21.0
but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed,0.0,11.0
the game ships with demo of metroid hunters 3d action title which can be played alone or with group of friends using the machine wireless capabilities,0.0,26.0
it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with group of people,0.0,16.0
the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim,0.0,12.0
the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers top-down map and the ability to switch weapons,0.0,22.0
it is certainly unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be little disorientating,0.0,18.0
super mario 64 ds is faithful re-creation of the nintendo 64 classic with host of new mini-games and new levels,1.0,20.0
the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such small machine,1.0,18.0
hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers,1.0,41.0
if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds key features then whole new market of gamers could open up,1.0,22.0
the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks,0.0,17.0

although the full story has not yet been told it seems that the problem started when plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows 2000 to windows xp went wrong and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network,1.0,44.0
this is certainly unfortunate but have lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved,1.0,17.0
today computer networks are large complex and occasionally fragile,0.0,9.0
the interconnectedness that we all value also gives us degree of instability and unpredictability that we can not design out of the systems,0.0,23.0
it is the network equivalent of godel theorem any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically,1.0,21.0
so will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was consequence of software failure or just bad luck,1.0,27.0
what is really disturbing and can not be excused is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press,0.0,30.0
it is without doubt major story and was the second or third lead item on bbc radio today programme throughout friday morning,1.0,22.0
so why did not the prime minister official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before friday,0.0,17.0
why was not the pensions minister in parliament to make an emergency statement on tuesday when it was clear that there was serious problem,1.0,24.0
if there had been an outbreak of legionnaire disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment,1.0,32.0
while eds and microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain we can learn some political lessons too,0.0,26.0
and the most important is that in this digital world technology failures are matters of public interest not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice care or understand,0.0,33.0
that means we need full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it,1.0,17.0
it would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege,0.0,19.0
major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently,1.0,19.0
anything less is betrayal of public trust,0.0,7.0

phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet rogue-dialling scams according to premium phone line regulator icstis,1.0,20.0
"it has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users knowledge",1.0,20.0
phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for,1.0,14.0
they must warn people earlier about possible fraud icstis said,0.0,10.0
people who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams,1.0,11.0
without realising program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via premium phone line,1.0,14.0
victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill,0.0,12.0
icstis spokesman rob dwight said phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner,1.0,15.0
if my bill goes over the usual 50 month want to know about it straight away don want to be told when it hit 750,0.0,25.0
phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic he said,1.0,16.0
we alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers he added,0.0,22.0
telecoms ombudsman elizabeth france said certainly would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if do something out of the ordinary,0.0,25.0
so would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have similar approach,1.0,16.0
the biggest phone company bt says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling,1.0,21.0
its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because under the current system once the call has been made there little that can be done,1.0,35.0
gavin patterson group managing director for bt consumer said we do look at customer calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary,0.0,28.0
we re looking at the moment at whether we can improve this,0.0,12.0
but as bt handled 180 million calls day monitoring was quite task in itself he added,0.0,16.0
the government has ordered review of premium line services and is likely to say icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future,1.0,26.0
at the moment it can not demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer it can only close illegal services down,0.0,20.0
use free anti-virus software avg and free firewall protection zonealarm,0.0,10.0
both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter love of music sites,0.0,22.0
how about isps informing all customers of such facilities,0.0,9.0
the responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues,0.0,20.0
ignorance is and always has been an expensive business,0.0,9.0
does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised,0.0,14.0
the phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently so are these people followed up and prosecuted,1.0,18.0
these diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal mp3s porn and pirated software,0.0,14.0
if people didn visit such sites they be considerably less at risk,0.0,12.0
it seems everyone has to be victim these days,0.0,9.0
part of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems,0.0,15.0
secure system should not allow web page or email to download and install anything without the user knowledge,0.0,18.0
these scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them,1.0,14.0
they should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators,0.0,10.0
or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going,0.0,19.0
why don bt et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer request,0.0,20.0
to anyone who falls foul of this scam refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls,1.0,17.0
after you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions they can not insist on you paying the bill,0.0,19.0
to do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud,0.0,14.0
no customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills,0.0,14.0
disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead then you have nothing to worry about,0.0,16.0
or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus,0.0,8.0
you would not walk out in the freezing cold without coat you would not drive your car without any insurance so why not protect your pc,0.0,26.0
stop blaming the phone companies it not their fault,1.0,9.0
was very impressed with our phone company recently,1.0,8.0
had kept ringing hotline number for kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number,1.0,27.0
and got the tickets as well,0.0,6.0
have colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam,1.0,11.0
he informed the phone company about it they subsequently put block on premium rate numbers,1.0,15.0
"three months later another huge bill of over 1,000 came in the block apparently didn work and he still has to pay for it even though block was in place",1.0,30.0
phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with huge bill otherwise they be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem,1.0,27.0
the operator will do nothing about this and to add insult to injury was charged vat by the government,0.0,19.0
premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented,1.0,14.0
one example was where thieves would set up premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid,1.0,26.0
the telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly,1.0,17.0
know people who have run up large bills despite being it-literate,0.0,11.0
from talking to bt in belfast believe that they will shortly be giving out free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing,0.0,25.0
it not the fault of phone companies and at last they are doing something about it,0.0,16.0
it about time that the profiteering by the legitimate phone companies came to an end mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up,1.0,32.0
not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly,0.0,24.0
haven fallen victim to rogue-dialling scam but think you re seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography,1.0,35.0
in most cases the user is entirely at fault which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them,0.0,22.0
my telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal to to 320,0.0,19.0
this was because of the scam,1.0,6.0
what particularly galls me over and above having over 300 stolen is that the supplier and the government through vat are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses,0.0,35.0
how about an automatic monthly cap of say 20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted,1.0,24.0
that way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage,1.0,13.0
at least any disputed amount would be limited far easier for telecoms operator to write off 20 than it is 750,0.0,21.0
few years back was also the target of such scams but thank god have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all heard was the sound of an attempted connection,1.0,35.0
how about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date,0.0,18.0
that should prevent the vast majority of these scams,0.0,9.0
net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites,1.0,12.0
internet portal lycos has made screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail,1.0,22.0
lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out,0.0,19.0
the net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data,0.0,25.0
we ve never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do said malte pollmann spokesman for lycos europe,1.0,28.0
in the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users he said but now we are going to go one step further,0.0,26.0
we ve found way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting load on their servers,0.0,18.0
by getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity,1.0,23.0
mr pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with,1.0,23.0
he said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web,1.0,25.0
every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day he said about one mp3 file,0.0,17.0
but he said if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day,0.0,22.0
lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back said mr pollmann,1.0,13.0
that would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing he said,0.0,13.0
the sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer,0.0,20.0
typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e-mail and they typically only get few thousand visitors per day,0.0,24.0
the list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as spamcop,0.0,20.0
to limit the chance of mistakes being made lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods,1.0,21.0
as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive said mr pollmann,1.0,23.0
sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests,0.0,11.0
early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85,0.0,15.0
users do not have to be registered users of lycos to download and use the screensaver,1.0,16.0
while working the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data,0.0,15.0
the screensaver is due to be launched across europe on december and before now has only been trialled in sweden,0.0,20.0
"despite the soft launch mr pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days",1.0,22.0
there huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more he said before now users have never had the chance to be bit more offensive,0.0,30.0
some details of the chip inside sony playstation have been revealed,1.0,11.0
sony ibm and toshiba have released limited data about the so-called cell chip that will be able to carry out trillions of calculations per second,1.0,25.0
the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together,0.0,15.0
the playstation is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch,0.0,26.0
the three firms have been working on the chip since 2001 but before now few details have been released about how it might function,1.0,24.0
in joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in february next year at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco,1.0,34.0
the three firms claim that the cell chip will be up to 10 times more powerful than existing processors,1.0,19.0
when put inside powerful computer servers the cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations or calculations every second,0.0,25.0
the chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media,0.0,26.0
ibm said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the us,0.0,17.0
the first machines off the line using the cell processor will be computer workstations and servers,0.0,16.0
working version of the ps3 is due to be shown off in may 2005 but full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006,0.0,29.0
as well as being inside the playstation the chip will also be used inside high-definition tvs and powerful computers,1.0,19.0
in the future all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network said ken kutaragi chief operating officer of sony,0.0,25.0

online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust says the institute of public policy research ippr,1.0,23.0
existing services such as ebay could provide good blueprint for such services says the think-tank,0.0,15.0
although the net is becoming part of local and central government its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online commons for public debate,1.0,27.0
in its report is online community policy tool the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities,1.0,21.0
adopting an ebay-type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster sense of local identity and connection,0.0,24.0
what we are proposing is civic commons will davies senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website,0.0,20.0
single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in way that might have policy implication like pre-legislation discussion,0.0,35.0
the idea of civic commons was originally proposed by stephen coleman professor of e-democracy at the oxford internet institute,0.0,19.0
the ippr report points to informal small scale examples of such commons that already exist,0.0,15.0
it mentions good-practice public initiatives like the bbc ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues,0.0,24.0
but he adds government could play bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too,1.0,18.0
proposals for id cards for instance could also be widened to see if they could be used online,1.0,18.0
they could provide the basis for secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online,1.0,17.0
at the moment they have been presented as way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services said mr davies,0.0,25.0
but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play role in decentralised online communities,0.0,18.0
the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other reputation by how they treat other members,1.0,27.0
using similar mechanism trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built,0.0,16.0
this could mean civic commons would work within non-market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly-recognised rules,0.0,23.0
e-government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web,0.0,29.0
many online communities such as chatrooms mailing lists community portals message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues,0.0,21.0
with 53 of uk households now with access to the net the government suggests mr davies could act as an intermediary or middleman to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more cosmopolitan politics and public trust in policy,1.0,43.0
government already plays critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online,1.0,13.0
but it should also play role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic non-market interactions said mr davies,0.0,20.0
there is role for public bodies like the bbc libraries and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of cliques talking to each other he added,1.0,31.0

consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs high-definition tvs digital radio and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005,0.0,22.0
all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry,1.0,14.0
despite showing diversity some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much wow factor as in previous years,0.0,19.0
the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces which was the time and place shifting of multimedia content being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere at any time,1.0,37.0
at the start of last year ces the cea predicted there would be an average growth of in 2004,0.0,19.0
that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players personal video recorders and digital cameras,1.0,20.0
it was clear also that gadgets are becoming lot more about lifestyle choice with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed,0.0,26.0
part of this has been the rise in spending power of the generation x-ers who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them,0.0,35.0
more than 57 of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers according to cea research,1.0,18.0

he disappointed some however by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console,0.0,19.0
another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony new portable games device the psp had at the show,1.0,18.0
sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe,0.0,17.0
it went on sale in japan before christmas,0.0,8.0
there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details,0.0,20.0

swap offer for pirated windows xp,0.0,6.0
computer giant microsoft has launched pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones,1.0,17.0
the first-time initiative is restricted to the uk and to users with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november,0.0,23.0
until december microsoft said software can be sent to it for analysis if there are doubts about its legitimacy,0.0,19.0
the company aims to detect illegal traders and turn users of fake versions of windows into legitimate ones,0.0,18.0
the windows xp counterfeit project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free subject to certain conditions until the end of the year,1.0,30.0
it is the first time microsoft has launched counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world the company told the bbc news website,1.0,22.0
in june the software giant said that the major security update to windows xp service pack would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system,1.0,29.0
the upgrade closed security loopholes in xp and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code,0.0,27.0
the us company invited anyone who had suspicions about their version of windows xp to submit it for testing as soon as possible,0.0,23.0
the procedure consists of series of computer checks collating documents and filling out witness statement,0.0,15.0
this is great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of windows xp software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders said alex hilton licence compliance manager at microsoft,1.0,30.0
the scheme has also been welcomed by the technology and commerce industry,0.0,12.0
it is important that users ensure that they are legally licensed to avoid the risks of purchasing and using counterfeit products said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce,0.0,32.0
the plan would enable microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in prompt way which would allow it to take action against software pirates,0.0,24.0
microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the uk programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries,1.0,19.0
"about 20,000 people have been banned from playing the half-life game",1.0,11.0
game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally,1.0,25.0
copies of half-life had been circulating on file-sharing systems soon after it was officially released,0.0,15.0
experts said the success of the half-life anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version,1.0,19.0
half-life was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online,1.0,29.0
authentication involved setting up an account with valve gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run,1.0,25.0
in statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies,0.0,21.0
the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half-life read the statement,0.0,33.0
"valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the 20,000 represented",0.0,30.0
one effect of steam popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game ranking in the top ten,0.0,27.0
even so the title debuted at no in the uk charts,0.0,11.0
valve also said that small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts,1.0,29.0
some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account,0.0,36.0
some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve anti-piracy actions,0.0,32.0
in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half-life keys copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game just to catch pirates and cheats were false,1.0,34.0
the company said the hack came from the community as do they all,0.0,13.0
it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of half-life circulating on file-swapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys,0.0,34.0
rob fahey editor of online news site gamesindustry.biz said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system,0.0,20.0
before now he said it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played,1.0,22.0
but with this valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half-life he said,0.0,18.0
if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to minimum said mr fahey other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems,1.0,26.0
it not hard to see point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games he said,0.0,32.0
this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steam-type systems that are used to batter people with adverts,0.0,20.0

new browser wins over net surfers,0.0,6.0
the proportion of surfers using microsoft internet explorer ie has dropped to below 90 say web analysts,0.0,17.0
net traffic monitor onestat.com has reported that the open-source browser firefox 1.0 released on november seems to be drawing users away from ie,1.0,23.0
while ie market share has dropped since may to 88.9 mozilla browsers including firefox have grown by,1.0,17.0
firefox is made by the mozilla foundation which was set up by former browser maker netscape in 1998,1.0,18.0
although there have been other preview versions of firefox version 1.0 was the first complete official program,0.0,17.0
it seems that people are switching from microsoft internet explorer to mozilla new firefox browser said niels brinkman co-founder of amsterdam-based onestat.com,1.0,22.0
mozilla browsers including firefox 1.0 now have 7.4 of the market share the figures suggest,1.0,15.0
mozilla said that more than five million have downloaded the free software since its official release,0.0,16.0
"supporters of the open-source software in the us managed to raise 250,000 133,000 to advertise the release of firefox 1.0 in the new york times and support the mozilla foundation",1.0,30.0
there was flurry of downloads on its first day of release,0.0,11.0
the figures echo similar research from net analyst websidestory which suggested that ie had 92.9 of users in october compared to 95.5 in june,0.0,24.0
microsoft ie has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from netscape and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95 mark,1.0,29.0
firefox is attractive to many because it is open-source,0.0,9.0
that means people are free to adapt the software core code to create other innovative features like add-ons or extensions to the program,0.0,23.0
fewer security holes have also been discovered so far in firefox than in ie,0.0,14.0
paul randle microsoft windows client product manager responded to the figures we certainly respect that some customers will choose alternative browsers and that choosing browser is about more than handful of features,0.0,32.0
microsoft continues to make significant investments in ie including service pack with advanced security technologies and continues to encourage vibrant ecosystem of third party add-ons for internet explorer,0.0,28.0

those downloading the software could find all the icons on their 7610 phone swapped for images of skulls,0.0,18.0
when installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610 functions making it hard to use and harder to repair,0.0,21.0
the program is only the latest in series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones,0.0,15.0
the file nicknamed skulls is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons such as wallpaper games and ringtones for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply result of bad programming,1.0,48.0
soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it,0.0,20.0
the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone,1.0,21.0
the skulls program is labelled as file called 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip,1.0,9.0
once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications such as contacts calendar notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless,0.0,35.0
the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls,0.0,12.0
statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it one of which includes ignoring security warning,0.0,38.0
symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program can not travel from one phone to another by itself,1.0,27.0
despite this finnish anti-virus lab f-secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it,0.0,19.0
the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again,1.0,21.0

analyst bill thompson has seen the future and it is in his son hands,0.0,14.0
bought my son max 3g phone partly because they are so cheap and he needed phone and partly because am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought should see how they work in real life,1.0,37.0

last week someone e-mailed me document that had been compressed into zip file and was pleasantly surprised to discover that my phone even knew how to decompress it for me,0.0,30.0
by contrast the confusing menus complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max 3g phone simply get in the way and did not see much value in the paid-for services especially the limited web access,1.0,36.0
the videos of entertainment news horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal and did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image never mind micro-tv,0.0,33.0
but then max started playing and realised was missing the point entirely,0.0,12.0
it is certainly not great overall experience but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout the video content itself is compelling,1.0,27.0
the quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the bbc website and the image is about the same size,1.0,23.0
max was completely captivated and was intrigued to discover that had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution,0.0,20.0
it is easy to be dismissive of small screens and indeed anyone of my generation with failing eyesight and the view that there never anything worth watching on tv is hardly going to embrace these phones,0.0,36.0
but just as the world wide web was the killer application that drove internet adoption music videos are going to drive 3g adoption,1.0,23.0
with vodafone now pushing its own 3g service and already established in the uk video on the phone is clearly going to become must-have for kids sitting on the school bus adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and group of friends to impress,1.0,48.0
this will please the network operators who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired 3g licences,0.0,18.0
but it goes deeper than that playing music videos on phone marks the beginning of move away from the download and play model we have all accepted for our ipods and mp3 players,1.0,33.0
after all why should want to carry 60gb of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when can simply listen to anything want whenever want streamed to my phone,0.0,31.0
oh and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts something which ensures that it is always in someone pocket or handbag available for other uses too,0.0,34.0
have never really approved of using the internet protocol ip to do either audio or video streaming and think that technically it is disaster to make phone calls over the net using voice over ip,1.0,35.0
but have to acknowledge that the net at least here in the developed western countries is fast and reliable enough to do both,0.0,23.0

but 3g networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming both for voice and video which gives them an edge over net-based ip services,1.0,26.0
the 3g services aren quite there yet and there is lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges,1.0,24.0
vodafone will let you access its services on vodafone live,0.0,10.0
as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites this one for example,0.0,23.0
this will not matter to business users but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company collection of partner sites something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator ofcom,0.0,33.0
but we should not see these new phones simply as cut-down network terminals,1.0,13.0
if want fast access to my e-mail can get 3g card for my laptop or hook up to wireless network,1.0,20.0
the phone is lot more and it is as combination of mini-tv personal communications device and music video player that it really works,0.0,23.0
there is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices accessing wide range of services over different networks,0.0,22.0
3g phones and ipods can co-exist at least for while but if had to bet on the long term would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket,1.0,31.0

you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting television set or computer,1.0,17.0
many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy tv,1.0,20.0
and now an indian-born computer engineer thinks he come up with way to give them cheap access to the internet,1.0,20.0
carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people,1.0,24.0
the first step is to figure out why poor people would want personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has pretty good idea of why they might,1.0,27.0
come from village says prof reddy know what the population is like many of them are illiterate and many of them have other concerns,1.0,24.0
there nobody will use it for the conventional uses of pc word processing and powerpoint he said,0.0,17.0
so it clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in village it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment education telemedicine and access to expert advice,1.0,35.0
prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach,1.0,17.0
after all he asked what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate indians let alone the billions of poor people around the world,1.0,28.0
instead prof reddy decided to think of those 250 million indians as potential market,1.0,14.0
the problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough,0.0,11.0
it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this prof reddy says,1.0,21.0
people do this today with television sets,0.0,7.0
if you go to india and many other countries they will first go get television set before they worry about one more meal,1.0,23.0
because personalized entertainment has become very important,0.0,7.0
he calls it pctvt personal computer television and telephone all in one that runs on normal desktop machine,0.0,18.0
literate users can surf through the applications with keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like television remote control,0.0,22.0
on the screen pictures not words designate applications like tv voice mail and video e-mail,0.0,15.0
this dependence on graphics video and audio means that computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for phd,1.0,26.0
prassana rambathla one of prof reddy graduate students says that when you re talking illiterate you re talking audio and video and that demands exponentially high bandwidth,1.0,27.0
it can choke at any point in time and it has to withstand anything no matter what you re pressing,0.0,20.0
the major part is making it foolproof very tough so that it never breaks he says,0.0,16.0
the carnegie mellon team says this project is only possible because pcs are now so much cheaper and have built-in audio and video hardware and software,0.0,26.0
limited trials of the pctvt are due to start this month in the indian state of andhra pradesh,0.0,18.0

we re doing lot of work on long-distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency when the power goes up and down and the links go up and down and the computers you re connected to just get turned off for no reason,0.0,50.0
prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about 10 month and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities,1.0,26.0
reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt other technologies such as video mail,1.0,14.0
for example farmer could use the pctvt webcam to send picture of harmful insect to local official who could send back proposed course of action to the farmer,0.0,28.0
prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off,1.0,11.0
the underlying problem he says is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy and improve their health care,0.0,25.0

meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser dream come true and branding nightmare,0.0,16.0
paul myers chief executive of wippit peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads believes it is time advertisers stopped providing oxygen for companies that support illegal downloading,1.0,29.0
you may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service edonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include nat west vodafone o2 first direct ntl and renault he said in an open letter to the british phonographic industry last month,1.0,51.0
he urged people to follow his lead and dump brands associated with companies such as edonkey,0.0,16.0
the bpi is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks,0.0,16.0
networks like edonkey kazaa and grokster facilitate illegal filesharing,0.0,9.0
the bpi strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue it said in statement,1.0,27.0
illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services,0.0,12.0
we are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such scale from their own businesses it said,1.0,24.0
but the issue is often more complicated for advertisers said mark mulligan music analyst with jupiter research,1.0,17.0
this has been problem for long time ever since the days of napster he told the bbc news website,0.0,19.0
the reality is that the millions of downloaders represent very attractive audience,0.0,12.0
advertisers probably pay lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience he said,1.0,24.0
if you put the legality issues aside not to advertise here would mean missing out on valuable audience he added,0.0,20.0
meanwhile companies contacted by the bbc news website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing,0.0,22.0
onetel adverts were spotted on edonkey this week and its response was typical,0.0,13.0
we have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge,0.0,20.0
it is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks read statement from the discount phone firm,0.0,17.0
it has requested the advert be removed immediately said spokeswoman,1.0,10.0
similarly telecommunications firm ntl blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites,0.0,20.0
since the matter was brought to its attention last month the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites spokesman told the bbc news website,1.0,31.0
however mr mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations,0.0,10.0
while smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends this is no excuse for well-known brands he said,1.0,28.0
would be surprised if these brands didn have the know-how to prevent this happening he said,1.0,16.0
at the moment edonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network,1.0,18.0
many big brands have leveraged the opportunity including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world senator john kerry and president george w. bush said chief executive sam yagan,0.0,30.0

toxic web links help virus spread,0.0,6.0
virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares,0.0,15.0
windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code,1.0,14.0
those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus,1.0,20.0
the trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti-virus software that combs through code contained in e-mail attachments,0.0,22.0
the virus that uses this trick is called bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 november,1.0,22.0
they exploit windows vulnerability that was discovered only few days earlier,0.0,11.0
like many other recent viruses bofra plunders the address book in microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses,0.0,28.0
the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but unlike many other recent viruses does not itself travel via mail,1.0,27.0
instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that when clicked on connect back to the machine that distributed that e-mail,0.0,25.0
essentially bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus,1.0,17.0
the messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for paypal transaction,0.0,26.0
copies of the messages seen by the bbc news website had bright yellow and green backgrounds,0.0,16.0
those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to,1.0,23.0
filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down,1.0,28.0
in the past other malicious programs have relied on single web server that downloads viral code to target machines,0.0,19.0
shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading,0.0,10.0
clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread,1.0,27.0
finnish anti-virus firm f-secure said that so far it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation,1.0,23.0
tim warner spokesman for anti-virus firm finjan said you have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating,0.0,23.0
mr warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code,0.0,19.0
most firms have secured their e-mail gateway said mr warner but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways,0.0,25.0
he said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims,0.0,25.0

millions to miss out on the net,0.0,7.0
by 2025 40 of the uk population will still be without internet access at home says study,0.0,17.0
around 23 million britons will miss out on wide range of essential services such as education and medical information predicts the report by telecoms giant bt,0.0,26.0
it compares to 27 million or 50 of the uk who are not currently online,0.0,15.0
the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is wishful thinking the report concludes,1.0,16.0
the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution,0.0,26.0
although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more the report suggests,1.0,25.0
as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access it predicts,1.0,33.0
the gap between have-nets and have-nots has been much talked about but predictions about how such divide will affect future generations has been less discussed,0.0,25.0
bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing,0.0,20.0
optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark the report suggests,1.0,25.0
internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it said adrian hosford director of corporate responsibility at bt,1.0,26.0
costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological,0.0,25.0
there is hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net,0.0,13.0
they don have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits said mr hosford,0.0,14.0
as now the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families the older generation and the disabled,0.0,20.0
those on low incomes will account for quarter of the digital have-nots the disabled will make up 16 and the elderly nearly third by 2025 the report forecasts,1.0,28.0
organisations such as bt have responsibility to help tackle the problem said mr hosford,1.0,14.0
the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain,1.0,23.0

such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome he said,1.0,25.0

faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests,0.0,18.0
instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake,0.0,22.0
consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in-depth study by handset maker ericsson,0.0,33.0
historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson consumer and enterprise lab,1.0,28.0
we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said,0.0,14.0
we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website,0.0,30.0
"for the study ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone",1.0,16.0
people habits remain the same said dr bjorn,1.0,8.0
they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it much more convenient way to do it,1.0,18.0
one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people he said,1.0,12.0
while diaries have always been popular mobile phone especially one equipped with camera helps them keep it in different form,1.0,20.0
youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in slightly changed way,0.0,28.0
dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles,1.0,35.0
ericsson research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways,0.0,16.0
dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use,1.0,26.0
for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago,0.0,17.0
this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch,0.0,24.0
another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists,1.0,25.0
only when about 25 of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it,0.0,38.0
once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off,0.0,16.0
dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be flop,1.0,23.0
however he said now 45 of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once month,1.0,19.0
in 2003 the figure was 29,0.0,6.0
similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise,0.0,15.0
in 2003 only of the people in the uk took phonecam snap at least once month,0.0,16.0
similar rises have been seen in many other european nations,0.0,10.0
dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras,1.0,20.0
usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said,0.0,16.0
digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays,0.0,15.0

the future is all about developing your own personal web said tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves,1.0,17.0
mr macklin said that too often when people use search engine it was like the first time they ever used it because there was no memory of what they had searched for before,1.0,33.0
each time you go back in you have to start all over again he said,0.0,15.0
the series of updates to its service collected under the my ask jeeves banner would help people remember where they had been before,0.0,23.0
ask jeeves has added the ability to save websites of interest so the next time users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found,1.0,29.0
sites saved in this way can be arranged in folders and have notes attached to them to explain why they were saved,0.0,22.0
mr macklin said many people wanted to save sites they had seen but did not want to add them to their bookmarks or favourites not least because such lists can not be easily searched,0.0,34.0
on average said mr macklin users conduct between five and 10 searches per day and the tools in my ask jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily,1.0,38.0
under my ask jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting,1.0,19.0
it about finding again what you found before he said,0.0,10.0
the my ask jeeves service lets people store up to 1000 web links or 5000 if they sign up to the free service,0.0,23.0
by way of comparison google desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited,1.0,22.0
at the same time search start-up blinkx has released second version of its eponymous software,0.0,15.0
blinkx is desktop search software that watches what someone is working on be it document or e-mail and suggests websites video clips blogs or documents on pc that are relevant to it,0.0,32.0
since blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as google copernic enfish x1 and apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their pc as well as the web,1.0,35.0
the competition has validated the problem we tackle said suranga chandratillake co-founder of blinkx,0.0,14.0
in the latest release of blinkx the company has added what it calls smart folders,0.0,15.0
once created the folders act as persistent queries that automatically sweep the web for pages related to their subject and catalogues relevant information documents or incoming e-mails on hard drives too,0.0,31.0
what users do with blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines,1.0,24.0
blinkx users do not stop using other web search systems he said,1.0,12.0
they might use google to look up company or yahoo for travel because they know they are good at that he said,0.0,22.0
the classic thing we have seen recently is people using blinkx to look at the things they have searched on he said,0.0,22.0
the variety of ways to search data was only helping users said mr chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks,1.0,31.0

some net service firms began blocking access to the lycos europe site in protest at the action,1.0,17.0
monitoring firm netcraft found that the anti-spam campaign was proving little too successful,0.0,13.0
according to response-time figures gathered by netcraft some of the sites that the screensaver targeted were being knocked offline by the constant data requests,0.0,24.0
in statement from lycos europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme the company denied that this was its fault,1.0,19.0
there is nothing to suggest that make love not spam has brought down any of the sites that it has targeted it said,1.0,23.0
at the time that netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down they were not in fact part of the make love not spam attack cycle it added,0.0,31.0
the statement issued by lycos also said that the centralised database it used ensured that traffic to the target sites left them with spare capacity,0.0,25.0
the idea was simply to slow spammers sites and this was achieved by the campaign the company said,1.0,18.0

the nem approach is to take serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline pick out the best bring them together and identify where the gaps are,0.0,31.0
where it finds holes it will develop standards to fill them,0.0,11.0
what is significant is that such large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget,1.0,27.0
this is bound to please if not surprise many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer,0.0,35.0

what happens here today we will see in nine months to years time in the uk adam hume the bbc broadcast futurologist told the bbc news website,0.0,27.0
for the likes of the bbc there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet,0.0,15.0
it is more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters but brand loyalty is important for everyone,0.0,19.0
we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands said tim hanlon from brand communications firm starcom mediavest,0.0,21.0
the reality is that with broadband connections anybody can be the producer of content,0.0,14.0
he added the challenge now is that it is hard to promote programme with so much choice,0.0,17.0
what this means said stacey jolna senior vice president of tv guide tv group is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers,1.0,33.0
it means that networks in us terms or channels could take leaf out of google book and be the search engine of the future instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch,1.0,37.0
this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them,0.0,27.0
but it might not suit everyone the panel recognised,0.0,9.0
older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting,0.0,18.0
they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands mr hanlon suggested,1.0,17.0
on the other end you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already everything is possible and available to them said mr hanlon,0.0,27.0

"of the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces many of them are about enhancing the tv-watching experience",0.0,20.0
high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd liquid crystal display tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them instead of being external boxes,1.0,29.0
one such example launched at the show is humax 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder,1.0,20.0
one of the us biggest satellite tv companies directtv has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability instant replay and search function,1.0,29.0
the set can pause and rewind tv for up to 90 hours,0.0,12.0

cyber criminals step up the pace,0.0,6.0
so-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004 say security experts,0.0,20.0
the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months,1.0,21.0
in 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages,1.0,11.0
other statistics show that in 2004 73 of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with virus,1.0,21.0
in its end-of-year report messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals,1.0,23.0
in september 2003 messagelabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations,0.0,27.0
but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month,1.0,17.0
worryingly said the firm phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data,0.0,22.0
older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as message is opened,1.0,33.0
other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards,0.0,22.0
e-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity said mark sunner chief technology officer at messagelabs,0.0,18.0
in just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online he said,0.0,21.0
mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation,1.0,19.0
already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed indicating shift from the random scattergun approach to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses he said,0.0,30.0

the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast creation,1.0,34.0
studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be,0.0,26.0
ever since the series then-groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga prince of persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts,1.0,38.0
those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect,1.0,15.0
combining them at speed is the best fun although getting handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill,0.0,20.0

warrior within is very slick package the game intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences,1.0,26.0
it is on par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of onimusha earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anti-climax,1.0,25.0
that said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game,1.0,18.0
the music is probably the worst aspect merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off,0.0,19.0
there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game,1.0,8.0
perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be,0.0,25.0
somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable,0.0,22.0

last month paramount universal and warner brothers said they were opting for the toshiba and nec-backed format hd-dvd high-definition discs,0.0,20.0
those studios currently produce about 45 of dvd content,0.0,9.0

"it found that more than 60 kept 1,000 to 2,000 music files on their devices making the uk digitally fat",0.0,20.0
virtual weight measurements are based on research by california institute of technology professor roy williams,0.0,15.0
he calculated physical comparisons for digital data in the mid-1990s,0.0,10.0
"he worked out that one gigabyte 1,000,000,000 bytes was the equivalent of pick-up truck filled with paper",0.0,17.0
the amount of data people are squirreling away on their gadgets is clearly sign that people are finding more things to do with their shiny things,0.0,26.0
if digital hoarding habits continue on this scale people could be carrying around digitally obese 20 gigabytes by next year,0.0,20.0
britain has become nation of information hoarders with ferocious appetite for data said martin larsson general manager of toshiba european storage device division,1.0,23.0
as storage capabilities increase and the features and functionalities of mobile devices expand to support movie files and entire libraries of multi-media content we will all become virtually obese he told the bbc news website,0.0,35.0
the survey reflects the increasing trend for portable devices with built-in hard drives like music and media players from apple creative labs archos iriver and others,1.0,26.0
this trend is set to grow according to analysts,0.0,9.0
they suggest the number of hard drives in consumer electronics gadgets could grow from 17 million last year to 55 million in 2006,1.0,23.0
consumers are driving the move towards smaller devices that have greater functionality and industry is trying to keep up said mr larsson,0.0,22.0
people are looking for more than just phone calls and text messages on the move they want things like web browsing e-mailing music photos and more,0.0,26.0
many are finding memory keys and memory sticks are simply not big enough to hold everything,0.0,16.0
floppies and memory keys have their place but they don have anything like the capacity or flexibility of hard drive so are unable to meet the demand for more and more storage capacity in consumer devices said mr larsson,1.0,39.0
the cost of making hard drives has dropped and is continuing to do so because of improved technologies so they are proving to be more cost-effective than other forms of memory he added,1.0,33.0
the amount of data that can be stored has grown by 400 in the last three years while the cost for every gigabyte has fallen by 80,1.0,27.0
it is also getting easier to transfer files from one device to another which has traditionally been slow and problematic area,0.0,21.0
transfer of data between different memory types has improved significantly in recent times and will be further helped by the standards for hard drives which are currently being developed by the major manufacturers said mr larsson,1.0,36.0

the growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms warns network monitoring company sandvine,1.0,18.0
it issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of halo,0.0,23.0
the november traffic explosion has continued into december said sandvine,0.0,10.0
service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth,1.0,18.0
as well as being popular single-player title halo can be connected to microsoft subscription-based broadband network xbox live,1.0,18.0
gamers who want to play online can create their own clan or team and take on others to see how well they compare,0.0,23.0
but the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic said sandvine chief technology officer marc morin,1.0,37.0
in bid to cope and ease congestion providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent finding out who is using bandwidth and for what,1.0,23.0
it could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use,0.0,14.0
the explosion in xbox live traffic attributed to halo should be seen as clarion call he said,1.0,17.0
isps need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games he added,0.0,20.0
one of the main factors that spoils online gaming is lag in which there is noticeable delay between gamer clicking on mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world,0.0,32.0
gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest lag,0.0,10.0
analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said lindsay schroth an analyst with research firm the yankee group,1.0,29.0

pocket-sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have big year in 2005 according to industry experts,1.0,22.0
last year saw the emergence of portable media players such as the windows-based creative zen portable media player the samsung yepp the iriver pmc-100 and the archos av400 series among others,1.0,31.0
but this year they are set to get smarter and more connected to allow people to find more video to watch on them,1.0,23.0
archos launched its latest range of its linux-based portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday,1.0,21.0
dubbed the pocket media assistant pma430 it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time,0.0,16.0
consumers are showing great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access said henri crohas chief of archos,0.0,24.0
and now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time,0.0,13.0
archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people pockets after the mobile,0.0,19.0
unlike windows-based players the archos av400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source such as tvs as well as playback,1.0,25.0
the content put onto the devices is copy protected so can not then be swapped to another device,0.0,18.0
recording is perhaps crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not lot of video to watch on it,1.0,27.0
and wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via high-speed wireless link,0.0,14.0
archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device,0.0,25.0
microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at ces primarily for us consumers though,1.0,17.0
it has agreed content deal with personal video recorder company tivo which bill gates also showcased in his keynote speech at ces,0.0,22.0
the tivo to go service means that us consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their tivos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the windows-based portable media players or smartphones,1.0,38.0
it also said it had launched service with mtv to let people watch comedy central vh1 and country music tv on its devices,1.0,23.0
and service is launching with msn to provide people with shortened versions of news entertainment and other video on subscription basis for download via the pc onto the portable devices,1.0,30.0
but the ability to record directly from tv vcr and digital cable and satellite boxes which windows-based devices do not offer certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too,1.0,32.0
the increased capability of these devices and the content deals that are being done may go some way to persuading people to use them,1.0,24.0
recent research by jupiter suggested that people would prefer device that was dedicated to music,0.0,15.0
only 13 of europeans wanted to watch video while on the move,0.0,12.0
more seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices,0.0,10.0
this year we are ready for an explosion of portable media microsoft mike coleman told the bbc news website,0.0,19.0
we are very bullish about it,0.0,6.0
the fact that can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer he added,0.0,19.0
the fact that europeans are far larger public transport users than americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too,0.0,26.0
there is burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work,0.0,18.0
although microsoft content distribution deals are for the us market at the moment talks were always on-going with european content suppliers to offer similar services,0.0,25.0
various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however,0.0,11.0
but that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices particularly via those which are wi-fi enabled,1.0,29.0
the possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work,1.0,24.0

aid workers trying to house feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the sudanese region of darfur are getting helping hand from advanced mapping technology,0.0,26.0
european consortium of companies and university groups known as respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps,1.0,20.0
the aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed,0.0,19.0
respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly,1.0,17.0
respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks for the rivers and for the villages to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes said einar bjorgo from unosat the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium,1.0,46.0
the group uses satellites from nasa the european space agency and the disaster monitoring constellation,0.0,15.0
the satellite data is transmitted to ground stations,0.0,8.0
from there the information makes its way to respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data,0.0,16.0
you have to convert the data into images then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis damage or situation maps said stefan voigt who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations the german aerospace centre,0.0,41.0
this kind of detailed analysis usually takes couple of months but respond gets it done in about 12 hours,0.0,19.0
our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery reading satellite maps so it our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very very efficiently said mr voigt,1.0,40.0
respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web and on compact disc,1.0,13.0
but the best map is one you can hold in your hands especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce,0.0,23.0
map is working document explains herbert hansen of respond belgian partner keyobs,0.0,12.0
you need to use it you need to write on it correct give feedback and so on so you need paper to write on,0.0,24.0
we print maps we laminate the maps we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take shower with the map it completely protected,1.0,24.0
humanitarian groups in darfur have been making good use of respond maps,1.0,12.0
they have come in especially handy during sudan rainy season when normally dry riverbeds or wadis became flooded,0.0,18.0
these wadis had very small amount of flooding generally in terms of depth but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground says stephen candillon of respond imaging partner sertit,0.0,36.0
respond rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times,1.0,28.0
aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it,1.0,20.0

faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests,0.0,18.0
instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake,0.0,22.0
consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in-depth study by telecommunications company ericsson,0.0,33.0
historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson consumer and enterprise lab,1.0,28.0
we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said,0.0,14.0
we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website,0.0,30.0
"for the study ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone",1.0,16.0
people habits remain the same said dr bjorn,1.0,8.0
they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it much more convenient way to do it,1.0,18.0
one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people he said,1.0,12.0
while diaries have always been popular mobile phone especially one equipped with camera helps them keep it in different form,1.0,20.0
youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in slightly changed way,0.0,28.0
dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles,1.0,35.0
ericsson research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways,0.0,16.0
dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use,1.0,26.0
for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago,0.0,17.0
this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch,0.0,24.0
another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists,1.0,25.0
only when about 25 of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it,0.0,38.0
once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off,0.0,16.0
dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be flop,1.0,23.0
however he said now 45 of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once month,1.0,19.0
in 2003 the figure was 29,0.0,6.0
similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise,0.0,15.0
in 2003 only of the people in the uk took phonecam snap at least once month,0.0,16.0
similar rises have been seen in many other european nations,0.0,10.0
dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras,1.0,20.0
usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said,0.0,16.0
digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays,0.0,15.0
by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture moment and were being woven into everyday life,1.0,21.0
millions to miss out on the net,0.0,7.0
by 2025 40 of the uk population will still be without internet access at home says study,0.0,17.0
around 23 million britons will miss out on wide range of essential services such as education and medical information predicts the report by telecoms giant bt,0.0,26.0
it compares to 27 million or 50 of the uk who are not currently online,0.0,15.0
the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is wishful thinking the report concludes,1.0,16.0
the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution,0.0,26.0
although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more the report suggests,1.0,25.0
as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access it predicts,1.0,33.0
the gap between have-nets and have-nots has been much talked about but predictions about how such divide will affect future generations has been less discussed,0.0,25.0
bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing,0.0,20.0
optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark the report suggests,1.0,25.0
internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it said adrian hosford director of corporate responsibility at bt,1.0,26.0
costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological,0.0,25.0

she added the real story of the digital revolution is not just new products but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell,0.0,27.0
part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content such as images video and music,1.0,20.0
crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device such as digital camera to others such as portable media players,0.0,38.0
lot of work still needs to be done however to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly she said,0.0,28.0

robotic pods take on car design,0.0,6.0
new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by japanese car giant toyota,1.0,17.0
the company vision for the single passenger in the 21st century involves the driver cruising by in four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet,1.0,34.0
both these prototypes will be demonstrated along with other concept vehicles and helper robots at the toyota stand at the expo 2005 in aichi japan in march 2005,1.0,28.0
the models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices which have few limits,0.0,14.0
the open leaf-like i-unit vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year,1.0,18.0
built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes,0.0,27.0
the model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into reclining position at higher speeds,0.0,29.0
body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and personal recognition system offers both information and music,0.0,18.0
also on display at the show will be the egg-shaped i-foot,0.0,11.0
this is two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with joystick,0.0,13.0
standing at height of well over seven feet 2.1 metres the unit can walk along at speed of about 1.35km 0.83mph and navigate staircases into the bargain,0.0,27.0
mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards,0.0,16.0
they are clearly what we call concept vehicles innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are few years away from actual production said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough university,1.0,40.0
they clearly have eye-catching appeal which is in part the name of the game here and are linked to the imac and ipod-type niche which apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years new different hi-tech image conscious products,0.0,42.0
as always with these concept vehicles it is difficult to see who they would appeal to and what their role would be in the personal transport marketplace,1.0,27.0
the personal transport arena is taking on new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities,1.0,17.0
toyota prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in vehicular form that is specially focused on transport,0.0,18.0
powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much us military research over the years and japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with wave of products being developed for specific applications,0.0,33.0
with an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population care giving and the military wearable exoskeletons seem to represent new line of future technologies that meet an individual particular mobility needs,1.0,34.0
while toyota prototypes are geared towards mass transport the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility,1.0,25.0
experts though are bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area,0.0,11.0
those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance now and certainly in the future are the elderly and infirm people dr gillingwater told the bbc news website,0.0,30.0
you have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups,1.0,14.0
dr erel avineri of the centre for transport and society at the university of the west of england in bristol said the design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled,1.0,42.0
for example one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up,0.0,32.0
it looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need,1.0,15.0
this and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered said dr avineri,1.0,24.0
in general introducing new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades,0.0,20.0
elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation,0.0,8.0
this may be another barrier to the commercial success of such vehicle,0.0,12.0
such single-person vehicles may find relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport,1.0,25.0
the concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg huge number of questions said dr gillingwater,1.0,22.0
how user-friendly will they really be,0.0,6.0
what infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used,0.0,12.0
overall think these vehicles pose number of important questions than provide answers or solutions,0.0,14.0

this is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to 7.5 million,0.0,24.0
getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying,1.0,33.0
the problem they face said shailendra jain head of mms firm adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets,1.0,26.0

the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant he said,1.0,15.0
the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users,0.0,24.0
no-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped said mr bud,1.0,23.0
this has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as wap-push to get multimedia to their customers,0.0,19.0

after years of buzz about high-definition tv hdtv it is finally taking off in handful of countries around the world mainly the us and japan,1.0,25.0
if you believe the hype then hdtv will so wow you that you will never want to go back to your old telly,0.0,23.0
hdtv is just the latest must-have technology in viewers homes says jo flaherty senior broadcaster with the cbs network in the us,0.0,22.0
all television images are made up of pixels going across the screen and scan lines going down,1.0,17.0
british tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels,1.0,13.0
"by contrast hdtv offers up to 1,080 active lines with each line made up of 1,920 pixels",1.0,17.0
the result is picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard tv,0.0,16.0
but to get the full impact programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need hdtv set to receive them,1.0,22.0
most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures,0.0,11.0
viewers in japan the us australia canada and south korea are already embracing the new tv technology with selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format which includes 5.1 digital surround sound,1.0,34.0

many high-end european tv programmes such as the recent athens olympics are already being produced in high-definition,1.0,17.0
but they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines,0.0,11.0

according to consultants strategy analytics only 12 of homes in europe will have tvs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008,0.0,22.0

the communications watchdog ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the uk switches off its analogue tv signal,0.0,21.0
for now broadcasters like the bbc are working on their own hdtv plans although with no launch date in sight,1.0,20.0
the bbc will start broadcasting in hdtv when the time is right and it would not be just showcase but whole set of programming says andy quested from the bbc high-definition support group,1.0,33.0
we have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010 which would put us on the leading edge,0.0,22.0

survey carried out by pc pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered better deal than handing your snaps to photo lab,0.0,25.0

but using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months warned the magazine,0.0,15.0
the group test of 100 home photo printers for pcs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as high street names such as jessops boots and snappy snaps,1.0,38.0
the comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage,0.0,28.0
it found that although some ink for printers now costs more than per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to high street store,1.0,37.0
if you really like your photos then it definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street but only if you choose the right printer said nick ross top tester at pc pro,1.0,36.0
mr ross said that new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many high street developers or even some professional wedding photographers,1.0,31.0
some high street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in said mr ross but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home,1.0,38.0
according to pc pro producing print 8x10in on an epson r800 printer using top quality paper costs 1.87,1.0,18.0
at jessops the same image would cost 2.50 and at snappy snaps 9.99,0.0,13.0
10x7in snap at boots would cost 4.99,0.0,7.0
considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the high street and how silver-halide prints can fade in the sun we re adamant that it now better cheaper and more convenient to print at home he said,1.0,38.0
ann simpson marketing manager at snappy snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers,0.0,19.0

recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchise,1.0,29.0
this title lacks that aura and when the bond magic shines through it feels like lucky accident,1.0,17.0
the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough,0.0,12.0
quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination,0.0,31.0

it is perhaps indicative of lack of confidence that the game maker allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights no time is risked with measured build-up,1.0,33.0
by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no goldfinger hat-fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion,1.0,41.0
there is real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains and it is testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such dash,0.0,28.0
but the in-game niggles combined with story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought-through will make this disappointment for most,0.0,23.0

video phone help for deaf people,0.0,6.0
deaf people who prefer to communicate using british sign language bsl could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter,1.0,26.0
the video relay service is being piloted by the royal national institute for deaf people rnid but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people pockets,1.0,39.0
the rnid is urging telecoms regulator ofcom to reduce the cost of the service from the current 7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls,0.0,29.0
the service works by putting deaf person in visual contact with bsl interpreter via webcam or video phone and the interpreter then relays the deaf person conversation using telephone and translates the other person response into sign language,1.0,38.0
for many deaf people especially those born deaf bsl is first and preferred means of communication,0.0,16.0
until now the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type message and have it relayed via an operator,0.0,23.0
in the past ve used textphones but they have problems said robert currington who is taking part in the pilot,0.0,20.0

there are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people said rnid technology director guido gybels,1.0,23.0
in the us and australia sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as voice call,1.0,22.0
by failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group,1.0,25.0
ofcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year,0.0,19.0

visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than passing resemblance to the better known if silent search engine google,1.0,27.0

but two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines,1.0,19.0
in may bt quietly announced that it was shaving 70 off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges so-called local loop unbundling,1.0,26.0
the vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes,0.0,13.0
at the moment bt has stranglehold on more than 80 of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what adsl products get into homes,0.0,26.0
with cheaper local loop unbundling rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise-like,1.0,22.0
it will mean the uk will finally catch up with countries such as france and the netherlands where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to 15mb megabits per second,0.0,30.0
and the major price fall means that rather than just talk about it companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into bt exchanges,0.0,25.0
it may not seem that exciting but it is remarkable transition given that just few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than passing resemblance to the northern ireland peace talks fraught bitter and with no end in sight,0.0,42.0
another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of bt reach meaning more than 95 of the population could get broadband regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived,1.0,36.0
there was slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1mbps broadband they still have to live within six kilometres of broadband-enabled exchange,1.0,23.0
for thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology the news meant they could finally join in,0.0,18.0
broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had bumper year,1.0,20.0
the biggest news for them was increased speeds introducing 2mb and 3mb services for users and offering free upgrade to those on 512k,1.0,23.0
the cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route,1.0,33.0
broadband can seem confusing for consumers with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set-up fees,0.0,28.0
it is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in 2005 but remains plane worth catching,0.0,17.0
as it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride,0.0,28.0
half of uk mobiles go online,0.0,6.0
multimedia mobile phones are finally showing signs of taking off with more britons using them to go online,0.0,18.0
figures from industry monitor the mobile data association mda show the number of phones with gprs and mms technology has doubled since last year,1.0,24.0
gprs lets people browse the web access news services mobile music and other applications like mobile chat,1.0,17.0
by the end of 2005 the mda predicts that 75 of all mobiles in the uk will be able to access the net via gprs,1.0,25.0
the mda say the figures for the three months up to 30 september are rapid increase on the figure for the same time the previous year,0.0,26.0
about 53 million people own mobile in the uk so the figures mean that half of those phones use gprs,1.0,20.0
gprs is often described as 2.5g technology 2.5 generation sitting between 2g and 3g technology which is like fast high-quality broadband internet for phones,0.0,24.0
with more services being offered by mobile operators people are finding more reasons to go online via their mobile,1.0,19.0
downloadable ringtones are still proving highly popular but so is mobile chat,0.0,12.0
bandaid was the fastest ever-selling ringtone this year according to the mda and chat was given some publicity when prime minister tony blair answered questions through mobile text chat,0.0,29.0
multimedia messaging services also looked brighter with 32 of all mobiles in the uk able to send or receive picture messages,0.0,21.0
this is 14 rise from last september figures,0.0,8.0
but recent report from continental research reflects the continuing battle mobile companies have to actually persuade people to go online and to use mms,1.0,24.0
it said that 36 of uk camera phone users had never sent multimedia message or mms,0.0,16.0
that was more than in 2003,0.0,6.0
mobile companies are keen for people to use multimedia functions their phones like sending mms and going online as this generates more money for them,1.0,25.0
but critics say that mms is confusing and some mobiles are too difficult to use,1.0,15.0
there have also been some issues over interoperability and being able to send mms form mobile using one network to different one,0.0,22.0
the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft then new xbox console,1.0,17.0
its sharp graphics and novel gameplay with the main character able to pause slow rewind and fast-forward time were meant to lure many fans to the new machine,0.0,28.0
but poor design meant the game became very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through level without the required tools to finish,0.0,23.0
thankfully the sequel has fixed many of the original faults,0.0,10.0
this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters,1.0,26.0
the character generator is very detailed and few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create unique personality to unleash on the game,0.0,22.0
as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions pig and feline assuming the role of your created characters,1.0,21.0
the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of missing time crystal,1.0,17.0
as in the original your feline persona can control time but this time the pigs get to control space,1.0,19.0
there are number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps space bubbles and void traps in order to progress,1.0,30.0
the control over space and time is achieved through number of vcr-style icons and is quite intuitive,1.0,17.0
annoyingly the puzzles are little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of chore than challenge to solve them,0.0,23.0
the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there are number of combat elements,0.0,27.0
these are little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to more dulled affair,0.0,19.0
but the game excellent graphics easily the best-looking platform game around sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans,0.0,25.0
blinx is out on xbox now,0.0,6.0
the odds are that when you fire up your browser you go straight to your favourite search engine rather than type in web address,1.0,24.0
some may see this as the height of laziness but in an era of information overload search has become vital tool in navigating the net,1.0,25.0
it is symptomatic of how the way we use the internet is changing,0.0,13.0
and as google has shown there is money in offering service that people can not live without,1.0,17.0
there is no shortage of companies vying for the loyalty of web searchers offering wealth of different services and tools to help you find what you want,0.0,27.0
over the past 12 months giants of the technology world such as microsoft and yahoo have sought to grab slice of the search action,1.0,24.0
user experience has contributed to people searching more said yonca brunini of yahoo,1.0,13.0
as people become more familiar with the internet they tend to spend more time online and ask more queries she said,0.0,21.0
the other second thing is broadband ms brunini told the bbc news website,0.0,13.0
this will do to internet what colour has done to tv,0.0,11.0
but search is hardly new phenomenon,1.0,6.0
it has been around since the early days of the net,0.0,11.0
veteran surfers will remember old-timers like hotbot and altavista,0.0,9.0
search was always important said urs holzle google vice-president of operations,1.0,11.0
it is even truer now as there are more users and more information,0.0,13.0
people didn realise that search was the future,1.0,8.0
the financials have something to do with it,0.0,8.0
google has shown web commerce can work through its targeted small adverts which appear at the top and down the right-hand side of page and are related to the original search,1.0,31.0
these small ads helped google reach revenues of 805.9m for the three months to september,0.0,15.0
others have woken up to the fact that you can make money out of web queries,0.0,16.0
once you see there is market microsoft is bound to step to it,0.0,13.0
if microsoft sees search as important then nobody queries it said mr holzle,1.0,13.0
microsoft is just one of the net giants muscling in on search,1.0,12.0
yahoo ask jeeves amazon and handful of smaller outfits are all seeking to capture eyeballs,0.0,15.0
web users face plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search,1.0,23.0
it reflects how the battlefield has shifted from the net to your pc,0.0,13.0
search is not just about finding your way around the web,1.0,11.0
it is now about unlocking information hidden in the gigabytes of documents images and music on hard drives,0.0,18.0
for all these advances search is still clumsy tool often failing to come up with exactly what you had in mind,1.0,21.0
in order to do better job search engines are trying to get to know you better doing better job of remembering cataloguing and managing all the information you come across,1.0,30.0
personalisation is going to be big area for the future said yahoo yonca brunini,0.0,14.0
whoever cracks that and gives you the information you want is going to be the winner,0.0,16.0
we have to understand you to give you better results that are tailored to you,0.0,15.0
this is perhaps the holy grail of search understanding what it is you are looking for and providing it quickly,0.0,20.0
the problem is that no one yet knows how to get there,0.0,12.0
computer giant ibm says 500 of its software patents will be released into the open development community,1.0,17.0
the move means developers will be able to use the technologies without paying for licence from the company,0.0,18.0
ibm described the step as new era in how it dealt with intellectual property and promised further patents would be made freely available,1.0,23.0
the patents include software for range of practices including text recognition and database management,1.0,14.0
traditional technology business policy is to amass patents and despite ibm announcement the company continues to follow this route,1.0,19.0
"ibm was granted 3,248 patents in 2004 more than any other firm in the us the new york times reports",1.0,20.0
for each of the past 12 years ibm has been granted more us patents than any other company,1.0,18.0
"ibm has received 25,772 us patents in that period and reportedly has more than 40,000 current patents",1.0,17.0
in statement dr john e. kelly ibm senior vice president technology and intellectual property said true innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted,1.0,28.0
it about innovating to benefit customers partners and society,0.0,9.0
our pledge today is the beginning of new era in how ibm will manage intellectual property,0.0,16.0
in the past ibm has supported the non-commercial operating system linux although critics have said this was done only as an attempt to undermine microsoft,1.0,25.0
the company said it wanted to encourage other firms to release patents into what it called patent commons,1.0,18.0
adam jollans ibm world-wide linux strategy manager said the move was genuine attempt to encourage innovation,0.0,16.0
we believe that releasing these patents will result in innovation moving more quickly,0.0,13.0
this is about encouraging collaboration and following model much like academia,0.0,11.0
mr jollans likened the plan for patent commons to the way the internet was developed and said everyone could take advantage of the result of collaboration,1.0,26.0
the internet impact has been on everyone,0.0,7.0
the benefits are there for everyone to take advantage of,0.0,10.0
stuart cohen chief executive of us firm open source development labs said the move could mean change in the way companies deal with patents,0.0,24.0
think other companies will follow suit he said,0.0,8.0
but not everyone was as supportive,0.0,6.0
florian mueller campaign manager of group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the european union dismissed ibm move as insubstantial,1.0,21.0
it just diversionary tactics wrote mr mueller who leadsnosoftwarepatents.com in message on the group website,0.0,15.0
let put this into perspective we re talking aboutroughly one percent of ibm worldwide patent portfolio,0.0,16.0
they filethat number of patents in about month time he added,0.0,11.0
ibm will continue to hold the 500 patents but it has pledged to seek no royalties from the patents,1.0,19.0
the company said it would not place any restrictions on companies groups or individuals who use them in open-source projects,0.0,20.0
open source software is developed by programmers who offer the source code the origins of the program for free and allow others to adapt or improve the software,0.0,28.0
end users have the right to modify and redistribute the software as well as the right to package and sell the software,0.0,22.0
other areas covered by the patents released by ibm include storage management simultaneous multiprocessing image processing networking and e-commerce,0.0,19.0
internet giant yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e-mail and other files on their pcs,1.0,18.0
the firm is following in the footsteps of microsoft google and ask jeeves which have offered similar services,0.0,18.0
search has become lucrative and hotly-contested area of expansion for net firms looking to extend loyalty beyond the web,1.0,19.0
with hard drives providing bigger storage users could need more help to locate important files such as photos,0.0,18.0
the desktop search technology has been licensed from us-based firm x1 technologies,1.0,12.0
it is designed to work alongside microsoft outlook and outlook express e-mail programs,0.0,13.0
searching e-mail effectively is becoming increasingly important especially as the amount of spam increases,0.0,14.0
according to research from message analysts the radicati group up to 45 of businesses critical information is stored in e-mail and attachments,0.0,22.0
yahoo software can also work separately on the desktop searching for music photos and other files,0.0,16.0
users can search under variety of criteria including file name size date and time,0.0,14.0
it doesn yet incorporate web searching although yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data,1.0,23.0
we are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content said julian smith an analyst with research firm jupiter,1.0,33.0
it is all about extending the idea of search and getting closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well he said,1.0,35.0
search engines are often the first port of call for users when they go onto the web,0.0,17.0
the new foray into desktop search has rung alarm bells for human rights groups concerned about the implications to privacy,1.0,20.0
and not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services,0.0,11.0
alexander linden vice president of emerging technologies at analyst firm gartner downloaded the google product but has since removed it,0.0,20.0
it was just not very interesting he said,0.0,8.0
he believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just way of keeping up with rivals,0.0,17.0
desktop search is just one of many features people would like but suspicious of its usefulness he said,1.0,18.0
more useful would be tools that can combine internet intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching he said,1.0,21.0
rings of steel combat net attacks,0.0,6.0
gambling is hugely popular especially with tech-savvy criminals,0.0,8.0
many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless ransom is paid,0.0,21.0
but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk biggest net firms to stop these attacks,0.0,21.0
increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures,0.0,27.0
net firms are realising that it not just about anti-virus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco,0.0,20.0
there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres,0.0,15.0
mr king said the only way to properly combat these so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems,1.0,19.0
many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king,1.0,40.0
this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale,0.0,15.0
malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time,1.0,25.0
bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said,1.0,15.0
it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said,0.0,18.0
so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave,1.0,14.0
however he added that it was only matter of time before such large attacks were mounted,0.0,16.0
maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days,1.0,25.0
the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites,0.0,24.0
it about understanding what genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said,1.0,17.0
we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella,1.0,41.0
this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends small part of the entire data flood,1.0,31.0
typically these computers have been infected by virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus,0.0,34.0
hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets,0.0,16.0
many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail,0.0,13.0
most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult,0.0,24.0
often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen,0.0,17.0
the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail said ms capella,1.0,17.0
we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning,0.0,24.0
once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up,1.0,21.0
energis took similar approach said mr seagrave,0.0,7.0
we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave,1.0,27.0
also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from,1.0,25.0
information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests,0.0,13.0
he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target,0.0,21.0
we have people in places where they shouldn be monitoring tech sites he said,0.0,14.0
sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy,0.0,10.0
you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave,1.0,20.0
man is facing charges of hacking into computers at the us arm of mobile phone firm t-mobile,1.0,17.0
the californian man nicholas lee jacobsen was arrested in october,0.0,10.0
mr jacobsen tried at least twice to hack t-mobile network and took names and social security numbers of 400 customers said company spokesman,0.0,23.0
the arrest came year after t-mobile uncovered the unauthorised access,0.0,10.0
the us secret service has been investigating the case,1.0,9.0
t-mobile has stringent procedures in place where we monitor for suspicious activity so that limited his activities and we were able to take corrective action immediately peter dobrow t-mobile spokesperson said,0.0,31.0
it is thought that mr jacobsen hacking campaign took place over at least seven months during which time he read e-mails and personal computer files according to court records,0.0,29.0
although mr jacobsen 21 managed to get hold of some data it is thought he failed to get customer credit card numbers which are stored on separate computer system said mr dobrow,1.0,32.0
t-mobile confirmed that the us secret service was also looking into whether the hacker accessed photos that t-mobile subscribers had taken with their camera phones,1.0,25.0
the associated press agency reported that mr jacobsen also read personal files on the secret service agent who was apparently investigating the case,1.0,23.0
los angeles grand jury indicted mr jacobsen with intentionally accessing computer system without authorisation and with the unauthorised impairment of protected computer between march and october 2004,0.0,27.0

users are being warned about windows virus that poses as the hugely popular tetris game,0.0,15.0
the cellery worm installs playable version of the classic falling blocks game on pcs that it has infected,1.0,18.0
while users play the game the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks,1.0,23.0
the risk of infection by cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild,1.0,24.0
the cellery worm does not spread via e-mail like many other viruses,0.0,12.0
instead it browses computer networks for pcs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines,0.0,21.0
when it infects machine cellery installs version of tetris that users can play,1.0,13.0
as the game starts up the worm also starts music file to accompany it,1.0,14.0
at the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines,1.0,13.0
the virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds,0.0,18.0
productivity may suffer too if users spend time playing tetris,0.0,10.0
pcs running windows 95 98 me nt 2000 and xp could be vulnerable to the worm,0.0,16.0
if your company has culture of allowing games to be played in the office your staff may believe this is simply new game that has been installed rather than something that should cause concern said graham cluley spokesman for anti-virus firm sophos,0.0,42.0
so far the number of people infected by cellery is thought to be very small and the risks of further infection is very low,0.0,24.0
sophos urged users and companies to update their anti-virus software to keep themselves protected,0.0,14.0
us state acts to stop spammers,0.0,6.0
us state texas has filed lawsuit against two men believed to be among the world top five spammers,1.0,18.0
it is seeking millions of dollars in damages in civil lawsuit filed earlier this week,0.0,15.0
the texas attorney general said it started the legal action as messages sent by the alleged spammers broke three laws governing e-mail marketing,1.0,23.0
the company named in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing and said it complied with all relevant laws,0.0,17.0
the texas lawsuit was filed against ryan samuel pitylak university oftexas student and mark stephen trotter of california,0.0,18.0
both are thought to be the top executives in three companies payperaction llc. leadplex llc,0.0,15.0
and leadplex inc that are suspected of sending out many millions of unwanted e-mail messages,0.0,15.0
illegal spam must be stopped said greg abbott texas attorney general announcing the legal action,1.0,15.0
spam is one of the most aggravating and pervasive problems facing consumers today,0.0,13.0
the attorney general alleges that messages sent by mr pitylak and mr trotter companies broke the 2003 controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act can-spam as well as the texas electronic mail and solicitation act and texas deceptive trade practices act,1.0,43.0
all three acts confer cash penalties for each violation of their terms,0.0,12.0
if the men are found guilty and all penalties are applied the two men could face damages bill running into millions,0.0,21.0
mr abbott said the messages sent by the pair broke laws by using misleading subject lines not identifying themselves as adverts and offering services for which they had no licence to do so in texas,1.0,35.0
lawyers for the alleged spammers said the lawsuit was groundless and the two men would defend themselves strongly against the accusations,1.0,21.0
leadplex and payperaction are legitimate internet marketing companies that are in complete compliance with the federal can-spam act said lin hughes speaking on behalf of mr pitylak and mr trotter,1.0,30.0
in similar move the us federal trade commission ftc has won court order that stops an international group of spammers sending sexually explicit e-mail,1.0,24.0
the ftc took the action because the messages being sent violated several parts of the can-spam act,0.0,17.0
in particular the pornographic messages did not identify themselves as being sexually explicit had deceptive subject headings did not have working opt-out mechanisms failed to mention they were adverts and did not give the sender real world address,0.0,38.0

souped-up wi-fi is on the horizon,0.0,6.0
super high-speed wireless data networks could soon be in use in the uk,0.0,13.0
the government wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called ultra wideband uwb,1.0,22.0
ofcom wants to ensure that the arrival of uwb-using devices does not cause problems for those that already use the same part of the radio spectrum,0.0,26.0
uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances,1.0,16.0
one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home,0.0,35.0
the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second,1.0,14.0
uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let person gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves,1.0,22.0
the technology works over range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data,0.0,21.0
at the recent consumer electronics show in las vegas products with uwb chips built-in got their first public airing,0.0,19.0
currently use of uwb is only allowed in the uk under strict licencing scheme,1.0,14.0
we re seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow uwb on licence-exempt basis said spokesman for ofcom,1.0,23.0
companies have until 24 march to respond,0.0,7.0
in april the ec is due to start its own consultation on europe-wide adoption of uwb,0.0,16.0
the cross-europe body for radio regulators known as the european conference of postal and telecommunications administrations cept is carrying out research for this harmonisation programme,0.0,25.0
early sight of the cept work has caused controversy as some think it over-emphasises uwb potential to interfere with existing users,0.0,21.0
by contrast preliminary ofcom report found that it would be quite straight-forward to deploy uwb without causing problems for those that already use it,1.0,24.0
the ofcom spokesman said it was considering imposing mask or set of technical restrictions on uwb-using devices,0.0,17.0
we would want these devices to have very strict controls on power levels so they can not transmit long way or over wide area he said,0.0,26.0
despite the current restrictions the technology is already being used,0.0,10.0
cambridge-based ubisense has about 40 customers around the world using the short-range radio technology said david theriault standards and regulatory liaison for ubisense,0.0,23.0
he said that uwb was driving novel ways to interact with computers,1.0,12.0
it like having 3d mouse all the time he said,0.0,10.0
he said that european decisions on what to do with uwb allied with ieee decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption,1.0,25.0
prior to its adoption as way for gadgets and computers to communicate uwb was used as sensing technology,1.0,18.0
it is used to spot such things as cracks under the surface of runways or to help firemen detect people through walls,0.0,22.0
ea to take on film and tv giants,0.0,8.0
video game giant electronic arts ea says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world,1.0,18.0
the us firm says it wants to compete with companies such as disney and will only achieve this by making games appeal to mainstream audiences,0.0,25.0
ea publishes blockbuster titles such as fifa and john madden as well as video game versions of movies such as harry potter and the james bond films,0.0,27.0
its revenues were 3bn 1.65bn in 2004 which ea hoped to double by 2009,0.0,14.0
ea is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each,0.0,24.0
nine of the 20 biggest-selling games in the uk last year were published by ea,0.0,15.0
gerhard florin ea managing director for european publishing said doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science,0.0,19.0
he said it would take many years before ea could challenge disney which in 2004 reported revenues of 30bn 16bn but it remained goal for the company,1.0,27.0
we will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional,0.0,16.0
mr florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion,0.0,19.0
"it the subtleties the eyes the mouth 5,000 polygons doesn really sell the emotion",0.0,14.0
"with ps3 and xbox we can go on the main character with 30,000 to 50,000 polygons he said",0.0,18.0
with that increased firepower the finding nemo video game looks just like the movie but it will be interactive,0.0,19.0
mr florin said that more than 50 of all ea games were sold to adults and played by adults but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children,1.0,31.0
our goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions,0.0,13.0
ea said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry,1.0,13.0
you can ignore an industry when people queue to buy game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it he said referring to demand for titles for such as grand theft auto san andreas and halo,1.0,38.0
jan bolz ea vice president of sales and marketing in europe said the firm was working to give video games more central role in popular culture,1.0,26.0
he said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over reality tv show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game the sims,1.0,31.0
one idea could be that you re controlling family telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world playing the show said mr bolz,0.0,41.0
he also said ea was planning an international awards show similar to the oscars and the grammys which would combine video games music and movies,1.0,25.0
mr bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities,1.0,13.0
people will want to play video games if their heroes like robbie williams or christina aguilera are in them,1.0,19.0
mr florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their 30s 40s and 50s,1.0,16.0
there an indication that 30 year old comes home from work and still wants to play games,0.0,17.0

an organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations,1.0,26.0
the motorsport endeavour club left the starting grid yesterday at the autosport international 2005 show at birmingham nec with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display,1.0,26.0
motorcycle racer roy tansley from derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated,1.0,25.0
needed to find way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg mr tansley told the bbc news website,1.0,23.0
in simple terms needed to invent left foot initially it was quite heath robinson device,0.0,15.0
mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing governing body the autocycle union,0.0,21.0
at that time they wouldn let any amputee race at all but eventually they told me could have licence as long as raced sidecars,0.0,24.0
mr tansley invention the pro-shift is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing,1.0,19.0
in addition to helping disabled riders to compete mr tansley reckons that the pro-shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt,1.0,30.0
as result there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance,0.0,18.0

it also has second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and hand operated brake bar,0.0,18.0
when joy rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition her father murray is former australian formula champion,0.0,23.0
and it was rainey senior who modified sports racer to accommodate his daughter small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs,0.0,24.0
she uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals cushion behind her back and raising the seat,1.0,20.0

web photo storage market hots up,0.0,6.0
an increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections,1.0,15.0
digital cameras were the hot gadget of christmas 2004 and worldwide sales of the cameras totalled 24bn last year,0.0,19.0
many people hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular,1.0,23.0
search firms such as google are also offering more complex tools for managing personal photo libraries,0.0,16.0
photo giants such as kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections lets users edit pictures online and provides print-ordering services,1.0,21.0
some services such as kodak ofoto and snapfish offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online,1.0,22.0
other sites such as pixagogo charge monthly fee,0.0,8.0
marcus hawkins editor of digital camera magazine said as file sizes of pictures increase storage becomes problem,1.0,17.0
people are using their hard drives backing up on cd and dvd and now they are using online storage solutions,0.0,20.0
they are place to store pictures to share their pictures with families and friends and they can print out their photos,1.0,21.0
while many of the services are aimed at the amateur and casual digital photographer other websites are geared up for enthusiasts who want to share tips and information,0.0,28.0
photosig is an online community of photographers who can critique each other work,0.0,13.0
on tuesday google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on computer hard drive,1.0,17.0
the tool called picasa automatically detects photos as they are added to pc whether sent via e-mail or transferred from digital camera,1.0,22.0
the software includes tools for restoring colour and removing red eye as well as sharpening images,0.0,16.0
photos can then be uploaded to sites such as ofoto,0.0,10.0
many people use the sites to edit and improve their favourite photographs before ordering prints,0.0,15.0
mr hawkins added the growth area is that you can order your prints online,1.0,14.0
friends and family can also access pictures you want them to see and they can print them out too,1.0,19.0
rather than just place to dump your pictures it about sharing them,0.0,12.0
the vast majority of pictures remain on pc hard drive which is why search tools such as those offered by google become increasingly important,0.0,24.0
but some historians and archivists are concerned that the need for perfect pictures will mean that those poor quality prints which offered tantilising glimpse of the past may disappear forever,0.0,30.0

speak easy plan for media players,0.0,6.0
music and film fans will be able to control their digital media players just by speaking to them under plans in development by two us firms,1.0,26.0
scansoft and gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control,1.0,20.0
they want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car or at home or on the move,1.0,22.0
huge media libraries on some players can make finding single songs hard,0.0,12.0
voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections said ross blanchard vice president of business development for gracenote,0.0,24.0
these applications will radically change the car entertainment experience allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel he added,0.0,28.0
gracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as apple itunes,0.0,16.0
the new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of collection just by saying its name,0.0,24.0
users will also be able to request music that fits mood or an occasion or film just by saying the actor name,1.0,22.0
speech is natural fit for today consumer devices particularly in mobile environments said alan schwartz vice president of speechworks division of scansoft,0.0,22.0
pairing our voice technologies with gracenote vast music database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to host of consumer devices and enable people to access their media in ways they ve never imagined,1.0,34.0
the two firms did not say if they were developing the technology for languages other than english,0.0,17.0
users will also be able to get more information on favourite song they have been listening to by asking what is this,0.0,22.0
portable players are becoming popular in cars and number of auto firms are working with apple to device interfaces to control the firm ipod music player,1.0,26.0
but with tens of thousands of songs able to be stored on one player voice control would make finding that elusive track by elvis presley much easier,0.0,27.0
the firms gave no indication about whether the ipod or any other media player were in mind for the use of the voice control technology,1.0,25.0
the companies estimate that the technology will be available in the fourth quarter of 2005,0.0,15.0
cable firms ntl and telewest have both launched video-on-demand services as the battle between satellite and cable tv heats up,1.0,20.0
movies from sony pictures walt disney touchstone miramax columbia and buena vista will be among those on offer,0.0,18.0
the service is similar to sky plus as users can pause fast forward and rewind content but they can not store programmes on their set top box yet,1.0,28.0
it could sound the death knell for some tv channels telewest predicts,0.0,12.0
it allows us to demonstrate clear competitive advantage over sky for the first time in many years said telewest chief executive eric tveter,1.0,23.0
video-on-demand will offer deeper range of content than currently exists on tv,1.0,12.0
there will be less compromising around the tv schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside said philip snalune director of products at telewest,0.0,29.0
telewest customers in bristol and ntl viewers in glasgow will be the first to test the new service which sees raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental,1.0,29.0
during the year the service will be extended to all cable regions,0.0,12.0
films will range in price from or for archived movies to 3.50 for current releases,0.0,15.0
new releases initially on offer will include 50 first dates kill bill volume gothika and the station agent,0.0,18.0
in addition ntl is offering children programmes adult content music video and concerts,0.0,13.0
telewest will launch similar services later in the year,1.0,9.0
ntl is also offering viewers the chance to catch up with programmes they have missed,0.0,15.0
its pick of the week service will offer selection of bbc programmes from the previous seven days such as eastenders casualty top gear and antiques roadshow,0.0,26.0
the bbc is trialling similar service offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their pc,1.0,19.0
for telewest it is the beginning of 20m investment in tv-on-demand which will also see the launch of personal video recorder pvr,1.0,22.0
pvr has been big success for sky because it gives customers control over programmes,0.0,14.0
satellite customers without pvr can not pause rewind or fast forward their programmes,0.0,13.0
with both services on offer from telewest mr tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial tv but also gain huge competitive advantage over sky,1.0,32.0
we offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and pvr he said,1.0,21.0
video rental stores may also have to watch their back,0.0,10.0
video-on-demand is better than having video-store in your living room and is more convenient he said,0.0,16.0
ntl said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering pvr but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand,1.0,20.0
pvr is recording mechanism whereas what we are offering is truly on demand said spokesman for the company,0.0,18.0
video-on-demand has the added advantage of not requiring separate set-top box or extra remote controls he added,0.0,17.0
adam thomas an analyst at research firm informa media believes the time is ripe for video-on-demand to flourish,0.0,18.0
while sky will remain the dominant force in uk pay tv for some time to come ntl and telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of vod enthusiasm and if marketed correctly this could help them eat into sky lead he said,1.0,45.0
the last 12 months have seen dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague windows pcs,0.0,17.0
"the count of known viruses broke the 100,000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50",1.0,20.0
similarly phishing attempts in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data are recording growth rates of more than 30 and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated,0.0,29.0
also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers called bot nets used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes,0.0,29.0
one of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make name by writing fast-spreading virus said kevin hogan senior manager in symantec security response group,1.0,33.0
although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code said mr hogan 2004 saw significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs,1.0,24.0
the financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology he said,0.0,11.0
his comment was echoed by graham cluley senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm sophos,0.0,14.0
mr cluley said when the commercial world gets involved things really get nasty,0.0,13.0
virus writers and hackers will be looking to make tidy sum,1.0,11.0
in particular phishing attacks which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers boomed during 2004,0.0,21.0
web portal lycos europe reported 500 increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching,0.0,17.0
the anti-phishing working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at rate of 30 or more per month,1.0,24.0
those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity,0.0,30.0
this change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages,1.0,30.0
they are not an efficient way of spreading viruses said mr hogan,1.0,12.0
they are very noisy and they are not technically challenging,0.0,10.0
the opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the netsky bagle and mydoom mass mailers but since then more surreptitious viruses or worms have dominated,0.0,27.0
mr hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting pcs to take part in bot nets that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites,1.0,31.0
"in september symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active bot computers rose from 2,000 to 30,000 per day",0.0,21.0
thanks to these bot nets spam continued to be problem in 2004,0.0,12.0
anti-spam firms report that in many cases legitimate e-mail has shrunk to less than 30 of messages,0.0,17.0
part of the reason that these bot nets have become so prevalent he said was due to big change in the way that many viruses were created,1.0,27.0
in the past many viruses such as netsky have been the work of an individual or group,0.0,17.0
by contrast said mr hogan the code for viruses such as gaobot spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time,1.0,32.0
"the result is that now there are more than 3,000 variations of the spybot worm",0.0,15.0
what makes it difficult is that they are all co-existing with each other and do not exist in an easy to understand chronology,0.0,23.0
the emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004,1.0,15.0
in the past threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild,0.0,27.0
in june the cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using bluetooth short-range radio technology,1.0,19.0
also released this year was the mosquito game for symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers and in november the skulls trojan came to light which can cripple phones,0.0,32.0
on the positive side finnish security firm f-secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers,1.0,27.0
in total eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29a virus writing group were sentenced,1.0,19.0
one high-profile arrest was that of german teenager sven jaschen who confessed to be behind the netsky and sasser virus families,0.0,21.0

the centre was supposed to be self-funded but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs,1.0,18.0
in statement media labs europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the irish government nor the prestigious us-based massachusetts institute of technology mit was willing to fund it,1.0,31.0
prime minister bertie ahern had wanted to the centre to become big draw for smaller hi-tech companies in an attempt to regenerate the area,0.0,24.0
about three dozen small firms were attracted to the area but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the labs long-term survival,1.0,25.0
the labs needed about 10 million euros us 13 million year from corporate sponsors to survive,1.0,16.0
in the end it was too deep and too long recession said simon jones the labs managing director,1.0,18.0
ian pearson bt futurologist told the bbc news website that the closure was real shame,0.0,15.0
bt was just one of the companies that had worked with the labs looking at rfid tag developments and video conferencing,1.0,21.0
there were lot of very talented creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society,0.0,28.0
have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs but the synergies from them working as team will be lost,1.0,26.0
noel dempsey the government communications minister said mr ahern had been very committed to the project,0.0,16.0
he is know very disappointed it has come to this,0.0,10.0
at the time it seemed to be the right thing to do he said,0.0,14.0
unfortunately the model is not sustainable one in the current climate,0.0,11.0
during its five years innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed,1.0,13.0
in recent months 14 patent applications had been filed by the labs,0.0,12.0
many concepts fed into science engineering and psychology as well as technology but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term,0.0,27.0
several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different,1.0,17.0

this information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands,0.0,13.0
other projects looked at using other human senses like touch to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment or on the body itself,0.0,26.0
one project examined how brainwaves could directly control computer game,0.0,10.0
the labs set up in an old guinness brewery housed around 100 people made up of staff researchers students collaborators and part-time undergraduate students,0.0,24.0

games help you learn and play,0.0,6.0
god games in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational says research,0.0,16.0
us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be good way to teach languages,1.0,17.0
ravi purushotma believes that the world of the sims can do better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods,0.0,21.0
the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of chore said mr purushotma,1.0,19.0
there must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of video game on computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework,0.0,34.0
but instead of fearing computer games ravi purushotma believes that educationalists particularly language teachers should embrace games,1.0,17.0
one goal would be to break what believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional he said,0.0,22.0
he believes that the phenomenal ability of games such as the sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation,0.0,25.0
the hard part of learning any language said mr purushotma were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences,1.0,30.0
boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be,0.0,25.0
the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride bike by formally studying gravity he said,1.0,23.0
by contrast said mr purushotma learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all,1.0,23.0
this was because the sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players,0.0,17.0
instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on,0.0,22.0
the incidental information about what sim was doing could reinforce what player or student was supposed to be learning said mr purushotma,1.0,22.0
by contrast many language lessons try to impart information about tongue with little context,0.0,14.0
for instance he said in version of the sims adapted to teach german if player misunderstood what was meant by the word energie the actions of tired sim stumbling then falling asleep would illustrate the meaning,0.0,36.0
if necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players or students understanding,0.0,15.0
one of the drawbacks of the sims said mr purushotma was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation,1.0,23.0
however online versions of the sims in which people have to move in meet the neighbours and get to know the local town could be adapted to help this,0.0,29.0
although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using game can help people learn mr purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help,1.0,31.0
getting simulated person to perform everyday activities in make-believe world and having them described in foreign language could be powerful learning aid he believes,1.0,24.0
before now he said educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games,0.0,20.0
but he said using pre-prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game,1.0,37.0
this could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons,1.0,17.0
hoping now to re-create well-polished german learning mod for the sequel by this summer he told the bbc news website,0.0,20.0
encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with japanese and spanish,0.0,13.0
earlier work with colleague on using civilisation iii to teach students about history showed that it could be powerful way to get them to realise that solving society problems can not always come from making single change,0.0,37.0
report on the experiment said students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play using geography and history as tools for their game and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play,0.0,37.0

the problem affects all users of itunes windows and mac os running versions 4.7 and earlier,1.0,16.0
users can automatically upgrade itunes by opening the look for updates window in the program,0.0,15.0
the security firm says users should avoid clicking on or accessing playlist files which have the file extension of .pls or .m3u which have come from unknown sources,0.0,28.0
itunes is the world most popular online music store with more than 200 million songs downloaded since it launched in 2003,0.0,21.0
technology firms sony philips matsushita and samsung are developing common way to stop people pirating digital music and video,0.0,19.0
the firms want to make system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying,1.0,20.0
the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different and conflicting content control systems experts warned,0.0,20.0
they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy,0.0,12.0
currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on small number of media players,0.0,26.0
systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems,0.0,19.0
by setting up the alliance to work on common control system the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats,1.0,24.0
in joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device independent of how they originally obtained that content,1.0,28.0
the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music movies and other digital content they have bought,1.0,27.0
called the marlin joint development association the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to,0.0,23.0
marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by group known as the coral consortium,0.0,26.0
the move is widely seen as way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft,1.0,34.0
confusingly for consumers the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple,1.0,26.0
in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats such as betamax and vhs that consumers have seen in the past said ian fogg personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research,1.0,37.0
the difference is that it is very fragmented he said,0.0,10.0
it not two-horse race it five six seven or even eight-horse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own,0.0,36.0
he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families,0.0,10.0
although initiatives such as microsoft plays for sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty he said life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come,0.0,31.0
shelley taylor analyst and author of report about online music services said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers,1.0,31.0
apple itunes service was perfect example of this she said,0.0,10.0
although itunes has been hugely successful apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods she said,0.0,23.0
she said rampant competition between online music services of which there are now 230 according to recent figures could drive more openness and freer file formats,0.0,26.0
it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run she said and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest,0.0,32.0
ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop,1.0,28.0
people want portability she said and with peer-to-peer they have 100 portability,0.0,12.0
cory doctorow european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims,0.0,27.0
not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying he said,1.0,14.0
he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy,1.0,28.0
instead said mr doctorow drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over consumers,1.0,20.0

peer-to-peer p2p networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says panel of industry experts,1.0,24.0
once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology,1.0,24.0
the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january,0.0,19.0
the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january,1.0,14.0
william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software,0.0,20.0
since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy,1.0,30.0
but that is going to change very soon according to the panel,0.0,12.0
the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks which are not illegal in themselves and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks,1.0,33.0
but they have slowly realised that p2p is good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want slice of it,1.0,35.0
they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards,0.0,22.0
but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with p2p can not not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks,1.0,21.0
remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said old media always tries to stop new media,0.0,21.0
when they can stop it they try to control it,0.0,10.0
then they figure out how to make money and they always make lot of money,0.0,15.0
once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business,0.0,24.0
in august 2004 the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two file-sharing networks,0.0,20.0
the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal,0.0,30.0
p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files,0.0,14.0
instead it uses direct connections between computers or clients,0.0,9.0
there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways,0.0,14.0
p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content,1.0,22.0
the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology,0.0,9.0
it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them,1.0,22.0
the files would be locked seven days after programme aired making rights management easier to control,0.0,16.0
but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many,0.0,10.0
the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half million films are downloaded day,0.0,24.0
legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content,0.0,23.0
sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004 with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months the ifpi reported this week,0.0,27.0
but such download services are very different from p2p networks not least because of the financial aspect,1.0,17.0
there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into golden egg for commercial entertainment companies,0.0,16.0
paid-for-pass-along in which firms receive money each time file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered,0.0,23.0
we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p said marc morgenstern vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer,1.0,21.0
consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern,0.0,15.0
but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations,1.0,28.0
unsigned bands for example use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign,1.0,26.0
increasingly what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content said derek broes from microsoft,1.0,15.0
they will probably pay an increasing role in helping p2p spread he said,1.0,13.0
looking into p2p future file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks as far as mr broes is concerned,1.0,20.0
once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said,0.0,27.0

big war games battle it out,0.0,6.0
the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice,1.0,25.0
the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats building on many of the original elements,1.0,20.0
for its part the long-running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue adapting the console game rising sun,1.0,23.0
call of duty finest hour casts you as succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war battlefronts including russia and north africa,1.0,22.0
it is traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character in the midst of unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you,1.0,24.0
on near-identical note medal of honor pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action,1.0,28.0
its arenas are the war pacific battles including guadalcanal and pearl harbour,0.0,12.0
you play one character throughout raw and rather talkative us soldier,0.0,11.0
both games rely on carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along,1.0,12.0
when this works it is brilliant device to make you feel part of story,0.0,14.0
when it does not it is tedious,0.0,7.0
winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii,0.0,21.0
you are first ushered into gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes then made to descend into sinking battleship to rescue crewman before seizing the anti-aircraft guns,0.0,28.0
it is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in video game,1.0,12.0
this notion of shuffling the player along studiously pre-determined path forcibly witnessing series of pre-set moments of action is perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic,1.0,32.0
the genius of something like half life is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection,0.0,20.0
this pair of games do not really accomplish that being more concerned with imparting full-on atmospheric experience,0.0,17.0
call of duty comes with suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation,0.0,11.0
finest hour has similar determination framing everything in moody wartime music archive footage and lots of reflective voice-overs,0.0,18.0
letting you play number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat,0.0,29.0
the game drawback could be said to be its format tastes differ but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc,0.0,24.0
the mouse control is big reason why along with the sharper graphics top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with bit more subtlety,1.0,32.0
call of duty on pc was more detailed plot-wise and graphically and this new adaptation feels little rough and ready,1.0,20.0
targeting with the ps2 controller proved tricky not helped by unconvincing collision-detection,0.0,12.0
you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him,0.0,22.0
checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot which happens regularly you are set harshly far back and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again,0.0,34.0
the game wants to be challenge and is and many players will like it for that,1.0,16.0
it is as dynamic battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive,0.0,33.0
both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour,0.0,17.0
and in pacific assault in particular their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless,0.0,13.0
but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all,0.0,24.0
of the two games pacific assault gets more things right including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation,1.0,20.0
it engages you very well and also looks wonderful making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry although we had to ramp up the settings on high-spec machine to get the most out of them,0.0,43.0
finest hour is by no means bad and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming,1.0,24.0
those looking for wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented,1.0,19.0
but they will also have niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break little more ground rather then just being competent,0.0,22.0
mobiles rack up 20 years of use,0.0,7.0
mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend,1.0,12.0
britain first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise,1.0,19.0
in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own handset,1.0,25.0
mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use landline,0.0,19.0
the first ever call over portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched,1.0,28.0
the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked,1.0,25.0
the first call was made from st katherine dock to vodafone head office in newbury which at the time was over curry house,0.0,23.0
for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with mobile network in the uk,1.0,18.0
then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service,0.0,10.0
"mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of briefcase cost about 2,000 and had battery life of little more than 20 minutes",1.0,30.0
despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s he said,0.0,11.0
they became yuppy must-have and status symbol among young wealthy business folk,0.0,12.0
this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on,1.0,23.0
he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million,0.0,24.0
it very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said,0.0,29.0
now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone,1.0,9.0
cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now t-mobile was launched,1.0,20.0
orange had its uk launch in 1994,0.0,7.0
both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology,0.0,13.0

security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs,0.0,17.0
the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range,1.0,26.0
the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series 60 phone operating system,1.0,15.0
despite the warnings there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir,1.0,20.0
the original cabir worm came to light in mid-june 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as proof-of-concept program,0.0,20.0
mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at time,1.0,31.0
however the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range,1.0,23.0
bluetooth has an effective range of few tens of metres,0.0,10.0
the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it,0.0,29.0
users can protect themselves by altering setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices,0.0,19.0
finnish security firm f-secure issued warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to phone,1.0,24.0
all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone battery,0.0,13.0
anti-virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created,0.0,30.0

legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of system that could be harder to shut down,0.0,23.0
one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program,1.0,23.0
test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january,0.0,13.0
but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies,0.0,16.0
in late december movie studios launched legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network,0.0,20.0
the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised,0.0,12.0
that file-sharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for,0.0,22.0
shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network,0.0,10.0
one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to,1.0,35.0
now the man behind suprnova.org who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for new file-swapping network dubbed exeem,0.0,22.0
in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems,1.0,20.0
like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want,1.0,15.0
like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone,0.0,9.0
there will be no centrally maintained list,0.0,7.0
this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music,1.0,21.0
the exeem software has been under development for few months and is currently being tested by closed group of users,0.0,20.0
an early public version of the software should be available before february,0.0,12.0
sloncek said that currently only windows version of the software was in development,1.0,13.0
there were no plans for linux or mac version,0.0,9.0
he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program,1.0,22.0
despite suprnova administrator sloncek involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis,0.0,30.0
users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream,1.0,24.0
dr johan pouwelse researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems,0.0,23.0
but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared,1.0,32.0
exeem can not prevent pollution he said,1.0,7.0
the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said,1.0,21.0
studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes,0.0,21.0
by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality,0.0,13.0
the moderators are the difference between having system that works and one that full of crap like kazaa he said,1.0,20.0
there is fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said,0.0,10.0
mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading,1.0,36.0
when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse,1.0,13.0
he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic,0.0,37.0
it hard to compete with free he said,0.0,8.0
no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development,0.0,17.0
games win for blu-ray dvd format,0.0,6.0
the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival according to its backers,0.0,16.0
blu-ray backed by 100 firms including sony is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games,1.0,25.0
the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format,1.0,19.0
the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound,1.0,11.0
this offers incredible 3d-like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year,0.0,23.0
in separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005,1.0,30.0
as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images we have much greater need for storage richard doherty from panasonic hollywood laboratories one of the pioneers of blu-ray told the bbc news website,0.0,35.0
so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today dvd,1.0,23.0
blu-ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high-quality data while toshiba hd-dvd will hold 30gb,1.0,17.0
mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders,1.0,30.0
both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out,1.0,37.0
when players do come out they will be able to play standard dvds too which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds,0.0,27.0
but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy,0.0,18.0
gaming is 20 billion industry worldwide so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made,0.0,21.0
the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies said michael heilmann chief technology officer for vivendi universal,0.0,21.0
blu-ray offers the capacity performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming,0.0,17.0
ea leading games developer and publisher added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning,1.0,35.0
sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations,1.0,15.0
mr doherty said gamers were ravenous for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles,1.0,17.0
gamers especially those working on pcs are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures deeper levels for delivering higher-resolution playback,0.0,21.0
he added the focus for games moving forward is on increased immersion,0.0,12.0
gaming companies really like to focus on creating world which involves creating complicated 3d models and textures and increasing the resolution increasing the frame rate all of these are part of getting more immersive experience,0.0,35.0
fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost,1.0,20.0
as games move to more photo-real capability the current technology is limiting,1.0,12.0
they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments said mr doherty,0.0,17.0
currently graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation,0.0,10.0
high-definition dvds will cut down on that need,0.0,8.0
likewise consoles rely on single discs so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better high-resolution games,0.0,20.0
blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios such as mgm studios disney and buena vista as well as top technology firms like dell lg samsung and phillips amongst others,0.0,31.0
while toshiba hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount universal and warner bros. the real world benefits of hd-dvd are apparent and obvious said jim cardwell president of warner home video,0.0,31.0
mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd,0.0,19.0
both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox but discussions are still on-going,0.0,21.0
next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data,1.0,13.0

she added the real story of the digital revolution is not just new products but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell,0.0,27.0
part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content such as images video and music,1.0,20.0
crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device such as digital camera to others such as portable media players,0.0,38.0
lot of work still needs to be done however to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly she said,0.0,28.0

gadget market to grow in 2005,0.0,6.0
the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005 delegates at the world largest gadget show in las vegas have been told,1.0,23.0
the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11 while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important,0.0,24.0
everything is going digital kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association told the bbc news website,1.0,16.0
the consumer electronics show ces featured the pick of 2005 products,1.0,11.0
consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs high-definition tvs digital radio and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005,0.0,22.0
all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry,1.0,14.0
despite showing diversity some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much wow factor as in previous years,0.0,19.0
the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces which was the time and place shifting of multimedia content being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere at any time,1.0,37.0
at the start of last year ces the cea predicted there would be an average growth of in 2004,0.0,19.0
that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players personal video recorders and digital cameras,1.0,20.0
it was clear also that gadgets are becoming lot more about lifestyle choice with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed,0.0,26.0
part of this has been the rise in spending power of the generation x-ers who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them,0.0,35.0
more than 57 of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers according to cea research,1.0,18.0
hybrid devices which combine number of multimedia functions were also in evidence on the show floor,1.0,16.0
lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it said stephen baker consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group,0.0,24.0
some of these functions cost next to nothing to add,0.0,10.0
as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant high-definition tvs several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders such as microsoft chief bill gates,1.0,31.0
despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate pre-show speech he announced several new partnerships mainly for the us market,0.0,20.0
he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices,1.0,22.0
he disappointed some however by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console,0.0,19.0
another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony new portable games device the psp had at the show,1.0,18.0
sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe,0.0,17.0
it went on sale in japan before christmas,0.0,8.0
there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details,0.0,20.0

apple has unveiled new low-cost macintosh computer for the masses billed as the mac mini,1.0,15.0
chief executive steve jobs showed off the new machine at his annual macworld speech in san francisco,0.0,17.0
the 499 macintosh sold for 339 in the uk was described by jobs as the most important mac made by apple,1.0,21.0
mr jobs also unveiled the ipod shuffle new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives which are used in more expensive ipods,1.0,25.0
the new computer shifts the company into new territory traditionally the firm is known as design and innovation-led firm rather than as mass-market manufacturer,0.0,24.0
the mac mini comes without monitor keyboard and mouse and second version with larger hard drive will also be sold for 599,0.0,22.0
the machine which will be available from 22 january was described by jobs as byodkm bring your own display keyboard and mouse,0.0,22.0
in an attempt to win over windows pc customers mr jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems,1.0,22.0
people who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses he said,0.0,13.0
it the newest and most affordable mac ever,0.0,8.0
the new computer has been the subject of speculation for several weeks and while few people will be surprised by the announcement many analysts had already said it was sensible move,1.0,31.0
in january apple sued website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer,1.0,17.0
ian harris deputy editor of uk magazine mac format said the machine would appeal to pc-owning consumers who had purchased an ipod,1.0,22.0
they want further taste of mac because they like what they have seen with ipod,0.0,15.0
harris added everybody thought that apple was happy to remain niche maker of luxury computers and moving into market dominated by low margin manufacturers like dell is bold move,0.0,29.0
but it shows that apple is keen to capitalise on the mass market success it had with the ipod,0.0,19.0
the mac mini will appeal to pc users looking for an attractive no fuss computer,0.0,15.0
the new ipod shuffle comes in two versions one offering 512mb of storage for 99 69 in the uk and second with one gigabyte of storage for 149 99 and went on sale tuesday,0.0,34.0

napster offers rented music to go,0.0,6.0
music downloading for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services can be costly business,0.0,17.0
the cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs,0.0,33.0
paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as more convenient and ultimately cheaper way of owning music,1.0,36.0
music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle either single tracks or subscriptions services said paul myers chief executive of wippit uk-based music download service,1.0,47.0
while itunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to ipod owners others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age,0.0,31.0
napster is due to launch new rental subscription service dubbed napster to go in the uk in the next few months,0.0,21.0
the service can be used on players that support microsoft windows latest digital rights management technology known as janus,0.0,19.0
this includes players made by samsung rio and creative,0.0,9.0
currently on offer in beta-version in the us the service costs 15 per month for unlimited downloads,1.0,17.0
the technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service,1.0,19.0
users need to update their license on monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play,0.0,16.0
this has outraged some digital music lovers especially as napster already offers cheaper service for downloading music to the pc,1.0,20.0
napster claims the higher price is result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers greater value for customers,0.0,25.0
mr myers is not convinced rental model will work for consumers,0.0,11.0
we ve been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want,1.0,22.0
format interoperability excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose he said,0.0,25.0
who wants to download track that won play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an ipod or the latest mobile phone,1.0,30.0

rings of steel combat net attacks,0.0,6.0
gambling is hugely popular especially with tech-savvy criminals,0.0,8.0
many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless ransom is paid,0.0,21.0
but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk biggest net firms to stop these attacks,0.0,21.0
increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures,0.0,27.0
net firms are realising that it not just about anti-virus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco,0.0,20.0
there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres,0.0,15.0
mr king said the only way to properly combat these so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems,1.0,19.0
many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king,1.0,40.0
this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale,0.0,15.0
malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time,1.0,25.0
bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said,1.0,15.0
it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said,0.0,18.0
so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave,1.0,14.0
however he added that it was only matter of time before such large attacks were mounted,0.0,16.0
maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days,1.0,25.0
the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites,0.0,24.0
it about understanding what genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said,1.0,17.0
we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella,1.0,41.0
this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends small part of the entire data flood,1.0,31.0
typically these computers have been infected by virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus,0.0,34.0
hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets,0.0,16.0
many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail,0.0,13.0
most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult,0.0,24.0
often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen,0.0,17.0
the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail said ms capella,1.0,17.0
we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning,0.0,24.0
once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up,1.0,21.0
energis took similar approach said mr seagrave,0.0,7.0
we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave,1.0,27.0
also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from,1.0,25.0
information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests,0.0,13.0
he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target,0.0,21.0
we have people in places where they shouldn be monitoring tech sites he said,0.0,14.0
sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy,0.0,10.0
you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave,1.0,20.0
apple mac mini gets warm welcome,0.0,6.0
the mac mini has been welcomed by apple fans industry experts and pc users,1.0,14.0
the release of the tiny low-cost machine is seen as good move for apple which currently has small share of the desktop computer market,0.0,24.0
mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers,1.0,22.0
they speculate that the mac mini will be bought by ipod owners and those wanting an easy-to-use and administer second home computer,0.0,22.0
it the bravest move they have made yet said jonny evans news editor at macworld magazine,0.0,16.0
mr evans said the combination of low cost small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it big success,0.0,21.0
he thought that the machine would appeal to those that like apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware,0.0,26.0
plus you know that you do not get viruses or all of the associated problems,0.0,15.0
already he said pc owning friends had declared that they would be buying one,0.0,14.0
interest in the new products launched at macworld expo was so strong that websites for apple store and the show struggled to cope with demand,0.0,25.0
according to response statistics gathered by netcraft many visiting the apple store in the wake of mr jobs speech suffered lengthy response times,0.0,23.0
the macworld expo site was completely overwhelmed and went offline,0.0,10.0
think fundamentally it good idea because it cheap even for pc said nick ross deputy labs editor at pc pro,0.0,20.0
apple work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans he said,1.0,18.0
think people expect it just to work now and really it should hesaid,0.0,13.0
the mac mini could find role in homes that need second computer that is easy to install and administer he said,1.0,21.0
for browsing the web e-mail and all kinds of basic duties it going to be absolutely adequate said mr ross,0.0,20.0
ian fogg broadband and personal technology analyst at jupiter research agreed that the mac mini could be very popular,0.0,19.0
apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have halo effect on the sales of the mac he said,1.0,21.0
before now he said apple has been seen as premium brand,1.0,11.0
but he said the mac mini changed that perception,1.0,9.0
it particularly good price when you see that it apple that is doing it he said,1.0,16.0
apple expects the mac mini to sell for 339 in the uk and 499 in the us,1.0,17.0
adding extras such as larger hard drive more memory and networking options will increase the basic price,0.0,17.0
it will go on sale from 22 january,0.0,8.0
for consumers interested in style design and small size which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in it natural next step said mr fogg,0.0,27.0
apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at said mr fogg who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction,1.0,30.0
his only misgivings were over how easy other consumers other than ipod owners would find using the machine,0.0,18.0
he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to hulking monitor,1.0,31.0
they be much more likely to pair mac mini with lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost he said,1.0,22.0
those with flat screens and lcd monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for new machine,0.0,23.0
there are also questions over whether the mac mini will work with very old peripherals such as display keyboard and mouse,0.0,21.0
the mac mini also fell short of being media server that can be video recorder as well as store for all the digital music movies and images people accumulate said mr fogg,1.0,32.0
the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet he said,1.0,12.0
it does not have the right connectors that fit tv screen or enough storage,0.0,14.0
said mr fogg it very much computer,1.0,7.0
one dissenting opinion came from brian gammage vice-president of research at analysts gartner,0.0,13.0
he said don think it changes the world,0.0,8.0
although the mac mini was very cheap for an apple computer it was still expensive compared to many pcs,1.0,19.0
also he said it appealed in categories that few consumers care about when buying home computer,0.0,16.0
the pc world is pile-em-high sell-em-cheap market he said and all of them are pretty interchangeable,0.0,16.0
since the days when apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on long slow decline he said,0.0,21.0
every few years it does something to give its market share kick then it starts to go back down again said mr gammage,0.0,23.0
the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend he said,1.0,13.0
the mac mini is the cheapest apple computer ever,1.0,9.0
but though it is cheap for mac how does it compare to pcs that cost about the same amount,1.0,19.0

apple computers are famously user friendly and offer much better network security which means fewer viruses,0.0,16.0

scansoft and gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control,1.0,20.0
they want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car or at home or on the move,1.0,22.0
huge media libraries on some players can make finding single songs hard,0.0,12.0
voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections said ross blanchard vice president of business development for gracenote,0.0,24.0
these applications will radically change the car entertainment experience allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel he added,0.0,28.0
gracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as apple itunes,0.0,16.0
the new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of collection just by saying its name,0.0,24.0
users will also be able to request music that fits mood or an occasion or film just by saying the actor name,1.0,22.0
speech is natural fit for today consumer devices particularly in mobile environments said alan schwartz vice president of speechworks division of scansoft,0.0,22.0
pairing our voice technologies with gracenote vast music database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to host of consumer devices and enable people to access their media in ways they ve never imagined,1.0,34.0
the two firms did not say if they were developing the technology for languages other than english,0.0,17.0

the first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the us,1.0,15.0
new yorker william trowbridge and texan michael chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software,0.0,24.0
the two men faced charges following raids in august on suspected pirates by the fbi,1.0,15.0
"the pair face jail terms of up to five years and 250,000 130,000 fine",0.0,14.0
in statement the us department of justice said the two men operated the central hubs in piracy community organised across the direct connect peer-to-peer network,1.0,25.0
the piracy group called itself the underground network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files,1.0,23.0
direct connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers,0.0,18.0
users would swap files such as films and music by exchanging data over the network,0.0,15.0
during its investigation fbi agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies 40 software programs 13 games and 178 sound recordings from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group,0.0,29.0
the raids were organised under the umbrella of operation digital gridlock which was aimed at fighting criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks,0.0,22.0
in total six raids were carried out in august,0.0,9.0
five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on net service firm,1.0,15.0

technology firms sony philips matsushita and samsung are developing common way to stop people pirating digital music and video,0.0,19.0
the firms want to make system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying,1.0,20.0
the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different and conflicting content control systems experts warned,0.0,20.0
they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy,0.0,12.0
currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on small number of media players,0.0,26.0
systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems,0.0,19.0
by setting up the alliance to work on common control system the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats,1.0,24.0
in joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device independent of how they originally obtained that content,1.0,28.0
the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music movies and other digital content they have bought,1.0,27.0
called the marlin joint development association the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to,0.0,23.0
marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by group known as the coral consortium,0.0,26.0
the move is widely seen as way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft,1.0,34.0
confusingly for consumers the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple,1.0,26.0
in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats such as betamax and vhs that consumers have seen in the past said ian fogg personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research,1.0,37.0
the difference is that it is very fragmented he said,0.0,10.0
it not two-horse race it five six seven or even eight-horse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own,0.0,36.0
he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families,0.0,10.0
although initiatives such as microsoft plays for sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty he said life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come,0.0,31.0
shelley taylor analyst and author of report about online music services said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers,1.0,31.0
apple itunes service was perfect example of this she said,0.0,10.0
although itunes has been hugely successful apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods she said,0.0,23.0
she said rampant competition between online music services of which there are now 230 according to recent figures could drive more openness and freer file formats,0.0,26.0
it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run she said and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest,0.0,32.0
ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop,1.0,28.0
people want portability she said and with peer-to-peer they have 100 portability,0.0,12.0
cory doctorow european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims,0.0,27.0
not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying he said,1.0,14.0
he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy,1.0,28.0
instead said mr doctorow drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over consumers,1.0,20.0

mobiles get set for visual radio,0.0,6.0
the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked,0.0,33.0
games cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years but 2005 could see another big innovation that won just see change in our mobile phone habits it might alter the way we listen to the radio,0.0,44.0
finnish handset giant nokia has been working on technology called visual radio which takes an existing fm signal from radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures,1.0,33.0
it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day,0.0,31.0
one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius senior project manager at nokia was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium,1.0,36.0
he said very happy to say it not television what we re talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today,0.0,24.0
if you have visual radio enabled handset when you hear an artist you don know or there competition or vote that you like to participate in you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you ve just been listening to,1.0,51.0
that visual channel is run from computer within the radio station and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to,1.0,28.0
as well as details on the track or artist of particular song there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself in similar way to digital television red button content,1.0,34.0
possible interactive content includes competitions votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing,0.0,17.0
but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on real-time basis,0.0,31.0
this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners,0.0,28.0
as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network,1.0,22.0
and there will be cost for the service as well although it may depend on your usage,0.0,17.0
if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it ll be two or three pounds per month said mr wasenius,0.0,21.0
but typically what we see happening is the operator offering package deal for an all you can eat arrangement per month,0.0,21.0
the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial-up connections,0.0,17.0
one thing that is for sure assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets it is estimating that there will be 100 million visual radio-enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006,0.0,35.0
basically visual radio is not really revolutionary but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before,1.0,29.0
the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in few months time with virgin radio who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners,1.0,29.0
station manager steve taylor commented listeners can interact with the radio station in new way,1.0,15.0
not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets,0.0,30.0
initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon the 3230 and 7710 but if successful it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them,1.0,33.0

tv films and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens,1.0,26.0
it is called high-definition hd for short and it is already hugely popular in japan and the us,0.0,18.0
it is set according to analysts to do for images what cds did for sound,0.0,15.0
different equipment able to receive hd signals is needed though and is expensive,1.0,13.0
but europe gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand,0.0,11.0
europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream hdtv,0.0,14.0
to view it it needs to be transmitted in hd format and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution,0.0,24.0
the next generation of consoles however are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005 start of 2006,0.0,19.0
and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures,0.0,16.0
in the next generation of consoles hd support is mandatory dr mark tuffy games systems director at digital content firm thx told the bbc news website,1.0,26.0
every game is going to be playable in hd,1.0,9.0
so consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on hdtvs and who have no content to watch are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures,0.0,31.0
it going to change really the way they look at gaming,0.0,11.0
at the end of last year chris deering sony european president made prediction that 20 million european households would have hdtv sets by 2008,0.0,24.0
"previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008 an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003",0.0,25.0
"but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology about 2,000 if there are few programmes or films to watch on them",0.0,31.0
satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006 and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by 2010,0.0,23.0
until broadcast rights format standards and the practicalities of updating equipment are agreed tv content will be limited,0.0,18.0
all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen and scan lines which go down the screen,0.0,21.0
most standard uk tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels,1.0,15.0
"hd offers up to 1,080 active lines with each line made up of 1,920 pixels",1.0,15.0
this means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard tv,0.0,14.0
probably in the uk gaming is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off as in look what this tv can do until hd is really adopted by broadcasters explains dr tuffy,1.0,40.0
but gamers are also the ideal target audience for hd because they always crave better quality graphics and more immersive gaming experiences,0.0,22.0
they are used to spending money on hardware to match game requirements,0.0,12.0
demographics have changed too and the sweet spot for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s,0.0,21.0
this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen high-definition display technologies and hd projectors earlier than others,0.0,26.0
higher capacity storage discs such as hd-dvd and blue-ray are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles allowing developers more room for detailed graphics,1.0,28.0
for console developers though hd offers some production changes,1.0,9.0
it could make games production slightly more expensive thinks dr tuffy,1.0,11.0
but we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take pc game and apply it to console he says,1.0,30.0
you are literally going to get to the point with lord of the rings game for example is going to be closer and closer to the actual film especially the cgi stuff from the dvd,1.0,35.0
and the transition when they move from cut scene to the game just now they have almost got it seamless,0.0,20.0
with hd he says the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release,1.0,19.0
this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry,0.0,12.0
but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide,1.0,19.0
at that point says dr tuffy games could become more or less interactive movies,1.0,14.0
the hi-tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware,0.0,10.0
bill thompson thinks it about time,1.0,6.0
my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as drove around cambridge,1.0,21.0
now you can buy petrol with lead additives and we re all better off as result,1.0,16.0
chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too reflecting growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways,1.0,37.0
apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic mercury cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents,0.0,39.0
and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops mobiles and music players,0.0,28.0
one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle,0.0,18.0
if you have got phone or computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive,0.0,23.0
well-designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost,0.0,11.0
this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling,1.0,32.0
they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears,0.0,42.0
it is as they say about time,0.0,7.0
we have long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment and waiting until there is crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage,0.0,37.0
the car engine is case in point lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder phenomenon called knocking so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere,1.0,43.0
redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was lot more work so it took decades before it was done,0.0,19.0
we re seeing the same thing in the technology industry and as result there are billions of devices from old mobile phones to antique handhelds that will have to be recycled in years to come,1.0,35.0
if apple gets its way then lot of people are going to be buying new mac mini and throwing away their old pc keeping the monitor and other peripherals,1.0,29.0
even if apple does not get its way four or five-year-old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it not unreasonable to replace them,0.0,27.0
but what do we do with the old ones,1.0,9.0
ve just looked around my office and find two monitors an old 386 pc two old handhelds three ancient laptops four antique mobile phones collection of rechargeable batteries and even sun workstation that is no longer really much use,1.0,39.0
they are all old enough to be hazardous waste the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead but it possible that some of the components could be useful,1.0,30.0
could take them up the to the council recycling centre but it 10-mile drive away across town and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best,0.0,30.0
here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste box for glass cans and paper that can be recycled and black bin for the rest,0.0,26.0
there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks,0.0,15.0
would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too,0.0,13.0
probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in box at least eventually,1.0,20.0

microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its windows operating system by restricting their access to security features,1.0,23.0
the windows genuine advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005,1.0,17.0
it will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates but their options would be limited,0.0,23.0
microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect pcs,1.0,11.0
either pcs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through microsoft site,0.0,13.0
those running pirated windows programs would not have access to other downloads and add-ons that the software giant offers,1.0,19.0
people who try to manually download security patches will have to let microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number,0.0,26.0
microsoft regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms viruses and other threats penetrating pcs,1.0,22.0
some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean rise in such attacks and threats with more pcs left unprotected,0.0,24.0
but graham cluley senior consultant at security firm sophos told the bbc news website that it was positive decision,0.0,19.0
it sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of windows is good news for everyone who uses the net he said,0.0,32.0
windows genuine advantage was first introduced as pilot scheme in september 2004 for english-language versions of windows,1.0,17.0
microsoft windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of,1.0,28.0
the company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time,1.0,18.0
software piracy has cost the company billions it says,0.0,9.0
the company announced earlier in january that it was releasing security tools to clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware which 90 of pcs are infected with,0.0,27.0
the virus-fighting program updated monthly is precursor to microsoft dedicated anti-virus software,0.0,12.0
last year it introduced the windows xp counterfeit project uk-based pilot scheme which ran from november to december,0.0,18.0
the scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november could replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones for free,0.0,29.0
it is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in china norway and the czech republic where pirated software is huge problem by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies windows,1.0,34.0

the next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers,1.0,22.0
we may not know when they will be released what they will be called or even what they will be able to do but one thing is certain they are coming,0.0,31.0
sony microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next 18 months,1.0,16.0
the details of playstation xbox codename xenon and nintendo so-called revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless,1.0,29.0
we know maybe what the ps3 will do but we can only guess said rory armes studio general manager for video game giant electronic arts in europe,1.0,27.0
it horrendous effort in the first year he admitted,0.0,9.0
microsoft had delivered development kits to ea said mr armes but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo to send kits,1.0,25.0
although the details may not be nailed down mr armes said ea was beginning to get sense of the capabilities of the new machines,1.0,24.0
the rumours are that playstation will have little more under the hood than xbox he said,0.0,16.0
microsoft is obviously software company first and foremost while sony has more experience in hardware,0.0,15.0
think sony will be able to push more into box at cost,0.0,12.0
what is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power,1.0,17.0
it is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub,0.0,19.0
at the consumer electronics show in las vegas microsoft boss bill gates said xbox would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle,0.0,24.0
while short on detail he painted picture of machine that would complement pc and offer great video gaming but video gaming for broader set of people more communications more media more connectivity,0.0,32.0
sony is thought to have similar vision for ps3 while nintendo remain focused on machine purely for games,0.0,18.0
until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do developers are working on first round of titles to harness the new horsepower,1.0,24.0
gary dunn development director at codemasters said the company had central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles,1.0,26.0

mr dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be major part of the new consoles,1.0,18.0
we want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in game,1.0,19.0

gerhard florin head of ea in europe said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games,1.0,21.0
many will be sceptical gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware but this time it would seem to be more likely,0.0,26.0
ps3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies said mr florin,1.0,10.0
he said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles,1.0,17.0

mr armes warned that developers still had to learn how to tell stories effectively in the medium,0.0,17.0
in some ways we are trying to forget about the hardware go in the opposite direction,0.0,16.0
we have been very bad at letting technology design our creativity,0.0,11.0
what we have to do as company is start ignoring the technology and learning our craft in telling stories,0.0,19.0
mr gardner agreed we can thrown more polygons around and have better ai but if it doesn make for better game then that not very useful,0.0,26.0

net browser opera 8.0 due for official release at the end of next month will be the most accessible browser on the market according to its authors,0.0,27.0
the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud,1.0,18.0
the voice features based on ibm technology are currently only available in the windows version,1.0,15.0
opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create style sheets its developers say,0.0,19.0
this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer,0.0,14.0
but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision,1.0,32.0
our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone said opera spokeswoman berit hanson,1.0,17.0
so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users,0.0,11.0
another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling,0.0,28.0
the company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with handheld device,0.0,16.0
the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people,1.0,16.0
our idea was to take first step in making human-computer interaction more natural said ms hanson,0.0,16.0
people are not always in situation where they can access keyboard so this makes the web more hands-free experience,0.0,19.0
unlike commercially available voice recognition software opera does not have to be trained to recognise an individual voice,1.0,18.0
around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear headset which incorporates microphone,1.0,16.0
the voice recognition function is currently only available in english,1.0,10.0

reviews of call of duty splinter cell pandora tomorrow lord of the rings and pocket kingdom will follow on monday if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for bit of surprise,0.0,39.0
this is because mobile games have come long way in very short time,1.0,13.0
even before nokia n-gage game phone launched in late 2003 many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset,1.0,28.0
and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be very lucrative market,0.0,24.0
that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can,1.0,33.0
life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed,0.0,28.0
now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste,0.0,24.0
there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled,0.0,16.0

there are shoot-em-ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets,1.0,15.0
rarely now does an action movie launch without mobile game tie-in,1.0,11.0
increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for film understandable when you realise that good game can rack up millions of downloads,0.0,25.0
the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost,1.0,13.0
what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push,1.0,29.0
by sending text message to game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset,1.0,16.0
far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals,0.0,14.0
the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too,1.0,12.0
almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available even the ones that use 3d graphics,1.0,28.0
the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too,1.0,19.0
now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing real option,0.0,16.0
the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too,1.0,21.0
some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in mobile,1.0,15.0
many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others,0.0,18.0
usually you can get hold of their best time and race against ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them,0.0,22.0
few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth short-range radio technology,1.0,27.0
with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening,0.0,19.0

web radio takes spanish rap global,0.0,6.0
spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music,0.0,17.0
but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop,1.0,10.0
hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad,1.0,21.0
but now us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere,1.0,15.0
los caballeros de plan are one of mexico hottest hip-hop acts,1.0,11.0
they have devoted fan base in their native monterrey,0.0,9.0
but most mexican hip-hop fans not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world rarely get chance to hear the group tracks on the radio,1.0,26.0
you can really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish it just not accessible says manuel millan native of san diego california,1.0,26.0
it really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio,1.0,13.0
you usually have very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world,0.0,20.0
millan and two friends set out to change that they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan accessible to fans globally,1.0,23.0
mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible,0.0,21.0
so millan and his friends launched website called latinohiphopradio.com,0.0,9.0
the name says it all it is web-based radio devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks,1.0,19.0
the site which is in both in english and spanish is meant to be easy to navigate,0.0,17.0
all the user has to do is download media player,0.0,10.0
it is just music streamed over the net for free,0.0,10.0
suddenly with the help of the website los caballeros de plan are producing export quality rap,0.0,16.0
the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now,1.0,14.0
the genre is in what millan calls its infant stage,0.0,10.0
but the production values are improving and artists such as argentina mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better,0.0,21.0
mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com,1.0,11.0
he considered the eminem of argentina and the latin american hip-hop scene millan says,1.0,14.0
he really hasn had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but he definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world,0.0,35.0
currently the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com top 10 as is cuban artist papo record,0.0,17.0
every country got it own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs millan says,0.0,19.0
latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for couple of months now,0.0,11.0
the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world,1.0,10.0
right now mexico leads the way accounting for about 50 of listeners,0.0,12.0
but web surfers in spain are logging in as well about 25 of the web station traffic comes from there,0.0,20.0
that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop,1.0,17.0
millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production,1.0,21.0
that might be changing though as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences,0.0,15.0
but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com top 10,0.0,10.0
his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain,1.0,17.0
on his track uno contra veinte emcees or one against 20 emcees tote king shows he is well aware of that fact,0.0,22.0
it basically him bragging that he one of the best emcees in spain right now millan says,1.0,17.0
he has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable it amazing,0.0,13.0
latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year,0.0,9.0

what high-definition will do to dvds,0.0,6.0
first it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment high-definition,1.0,25.0
high-definition gives incredible 3d-like pictures and surround sound,0.0,8.0
the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still number of issues to be sorted out,0.0,30.0
but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment,1.0,18.0
for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx high-definition future is an exciting prospect,0.0,18.0
he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones,0.0,16.0
there was time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website,0.0,26.0
the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined,0.0,13.0
the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says,1.0,23.0
but currently putting master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology can not hold as much as high-definition films demand,1.0,24.0
as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains,0.0,30.0
would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and find it very exciting,0.0,26.0
high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to,1.0,17.0
it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months time,1.0,30.0
mr dean is confident though think if they see real hd high-definition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such remarkable difference,1.0,24.0
have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen,0.0,13.0
high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too,1.0,12.0
on the whole producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed,1.0,19.0
equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd,1.0,16.0
when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second says mr dean,1.0,20.0
our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second,0.0,20.0
that huge amount of compression that has to be applied about 98,0.0,12.0
so if you have anything that allows more space you don have to compress so hard,0.0,16.0
studios could fit lot more marketing material games and features onto high-capacity dvds,0.0,13.0
currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean,1.0,14.0
although the step of down-converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save day work says mr dean,0.0,18.0
one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems,0.0,14.0
on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone,0.0,18.0
if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay,1.0,22.0
if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required,0.0,33.0
and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it,1.0,26.0
those costs could filter down to the price ticket on high-definition dvd,1.0,12.0
but if the consumer is not willing to pay premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean,0.0,17.0
high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike,1.0,12.0
more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous,0.0,18.0
when we did the first hd version of star wars episode everybody was very sun-tanned but that was make-up,0.0,19.0
in the hd version of episode all these make-up lines showed up explains mr dean,1.0,15.0
the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too,0.0,13.0
there are scans of corridor on the death star and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways,0.0,27.0
you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn see it,0.0,24.0
what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur,1.0,17.0
with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further,0.0,14.0
it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen,0.0,15.0
in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol broadband giving dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive says mr dean,0.0,30.0
but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves,0.0,22.0

net users are being told to avoid scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims,0.0,19.0
the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage,0.0,17.0
however dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it,0.0,18.0
the site is just the latest in long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster,1.0,24.0
the link to the website is contained in spam e-mail that is currently circulating,0.0,14.0
the message subject line reads urgent tsunami earthquake appeal and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts,0.0,26.0
the web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate,1.0,26.0
patricia sanders spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down,1.0,31.0

dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation,1.0,20.0
bt and dec hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down she said,1.0,17.0
ms sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not dec style and that it would never canvass support in this way,0.0,24.0
she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible,1.0,16.0
all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed,1.0,16.0

this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid,0.0,21.0
one e-mail sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from bank account in the netherlands,0.0,35.0

more women turn to net security,0.0,6.0
older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks according to two-year study,1.0,20.0
the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2 each year between 2002 and 2004,1.0,24.0
the study for net security firm preventon shows that security messages are reaching diversity of surfers,1.0,16.0
it is thought that 40 of those buying home net security programs are retired,1.0,14.0
for the last three years that has gone up by an average of 13.2,0.0,14.0
but more retired women 53 were buying security software than retired men,1.0,12.0
the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers,0.0,29.0
the study predicts that 40 of all home pc net security buyers will be women in 2005,1.0,17.0
they could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007 if current rates persist according to the research,0.0,19.0
think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong said one over-60 woman who took part in the research,0.0,39.0
you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years paul goosens head of preventon told the bbc news website,0.0,23.0
now we are seeing real people both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home,0.0,20.0
but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online particuarly if they are new to broadband he said,1.0,32.0
programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with slower connection too said mr goosens,0.0,22.0
security software should be easy to use with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language he added,0.0,18.0
the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses,0.0,15.0
high-profile complaints about rogue diallers and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers have also raised awareness about the need to have combination of anti-virus firewall and spyware-removal programs too,0.0,33.0
without protection these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally,0.0,16.0
"more than 30,000 pcs day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses study from security from symantec showed last year",1.0,24.0
viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer according to net security experts,1.0,17.0
programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs many based in eastern europe over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance,0.0,27.0
the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because said mr goosens they are reported in the press much more,1.0,26.0
you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat,0.0,19.0
they are asking the right questions he explained,0.0,8.0
it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using reputable service provider that they are safe to connect to the net,0.0,27.0

google acquired pyra labs makers of the blogger software in 2003,0.0,11.0
in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do better job of handling blog entries,0.0,22.0
jim lanzone vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us said it did not acquire bloglines just to get foothold in the blog publishing world,1.0,28.0
he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it,1.0,23.0
the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers he said,0.0,14.0
mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up personal collection of useful links,1.0,29.0
search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites he said,0.0,26.0
it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates,1.0,17.0
there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines said mr lanzone,1.0,12.0
our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away he said,0.0,24.0
though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology,1.0,25.0
being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right said mr lanzone,0.0,22.0
rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders,0.0,20.0
why cell will get the hard sell,0.0,7.0
the world is casting its gaze on the cell processor for the first time but what is so important about it and why is it so different,1.0,27.0
the backers of the processor are big names in the computer industry,0.0,12.0
ibm is one of the largest and most respected chip-makers in the world providing cutting edge technology to large businesses,0.0,20.0
sony will be using the chip inside its playstation console and its dominance of the games market means that it now has lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms,1.0,34.0
the technology inside the cell is being heralded as revolutionary from technical standpoint,1.0,13.0
traditional computers whether they are household pcs or playstation 2s use single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer,1.0,22.0
the cell technology on the other hand uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously,1.0,19.0
this gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors,0.0,12.0
whilst its rivals are working on similar technology it is sony which is the most advanced,0.0,16.0
the speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years but the memory technology that accompanies the cell is huge leap in performance,1.0,27.0
using technology called xdr created by american firm rambus memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by intel,0.0,25.0
perhaps more important than any of the technology is the cell role in the imminent war on living rooms,0.0,19.0
the big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as dvd players and hi-fis,0.0,22.0
companies like microsoft and sony believe that there is lot of money to be made by putting computer underneath the tv of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place,0.0,51.0
microsoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its windows media center software which has been adopted by many pc makers,0.0,25.0
sony had stab at something similar with the psx variation on the playstation last year in japan although this attempt was generally seen as failure,0.0,25.0
both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles to make them as powerful as pcs will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack,0.0,36.0
sony and ibm want to make sure that the dominance of the pc market enjoyed by microsoft and intel is not allowed to extend to this market,0.0,27.0
by creating radically new architecture and using that architecture in games console that is sure to be huge seller they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room shutting out their rivals,1.0,38.0
once they have established themselves under the tv there is no doubt that they hope to use this as base camp to extend their might into our traditional pcs and instigate regime change on the desktop,0.0,36.0
cell is in fact specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house,0.0,12.0
the links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach cell processors in entirely different systems,1.0,18.0
sony hopes to put cells in televisions kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip,0.0,19.0
each cell will be linked to the others creating vast home network of computing power,1.0,15.0
resources of the cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other so that you can programme your microwave from your tv for example,0.0,41.0
this digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the cell processor and there are as with all things number of reasons it could fail,1.0,28.0
because the processor is so different it requires programmers to learn different way of writing software and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master,0.0,31.0
you can also guarantee that microsoft and intel are not going to sit around and let cell take over home computing without fight,1.0,23.0
microsoft is going to be pushing its xbox as hard as possible to make sure that its technology not sony will be under your tree next christmas,0.0,27.0
intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create rival technology to cell so that it doesn lose its desktop pc dominance,1.0,31.0
if cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice however it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future,1.0,25.0
the revolution might not be televised but it could well be played with videogame controller,0.0,15.0
the cell processor which will drive sony playstation will run 10-times faster than current pc chips its designers have said,1.0,20.0
sony ibm and toshiba who have been working on the cell processor for three years unveiled the chip on monday,1.0,20.0
it is being designed for use in graphics workstations the new playstation console and has been described as supercomputer on chip,1.0,21.0
the chip will run at speeds of greater than ghz the firms said,1.0,13.0
by comparison rival chip maker intel fastest processor runs at 3.8 ghz,1.0,12.0
details of the chip were released at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco,0.0,16.0
the new processor is set to ignite fresh battle between intel and the cell consortium over which processor sits at the centre of digital products,0.0,25.0
the playstation is expected in 2006 while toshiba plans to incorporate it into high-end televisions next year,0.0,17.0
ibm has said it will sell workstation with the chip starting later this year,1.0,14.0
cell is comprised of several computing engines or cores,0.0,9.0
core based on ibm power architecture controls eight synergistic processing centres,0.0,11.0
in all they can simultaneously carry out 10 instruction sequences compared with two for current intel chips,0.0,17.0
later this year intel and advanced micro devices plan to release their own multicore chips which also increase the number of instructions that can be executed at once,0.0,28.0
the cell specifications suggest the playstation will offer significant boost in graphics capabilities but analysts cautioned that not all the features in product announcement will find their way into systems,0.0,30.0
any new technology like this has two components said steve kleynhans an analyst with meta group,0.0,16.0
he said it has the vision of what it could be because you need the big vision to sell it,0.0,20.0
then there the reality of how it really going to be used which generally is several levels down the chain from there,0.0,22.0
while the playstation is likely to be the first mass-market product to use cell the chip designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for wide range of applications from servers to mobile phones,1.0,38.0
initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than games console however because the first version of the cell will run hot enough to need cooling fan,0.0,27.0
and while marketing speak describes the chip as supercomputer it remains significantly slower than the slowest computer on the list of the world top 500 supercomputers,0.0,26.0
ibm said cell was os neutral and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if microsoft windows was among those tested with the chip,1.0,28.0
if cell is to challenge intel range of chips in the marketplace it will need to find itself inside pcs which predominantly run using windows,1.0,25.0
